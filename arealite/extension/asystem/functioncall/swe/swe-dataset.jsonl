The error message is:\n\n```\nerror: Addon error: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/martin/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\", line 48, in request\n    self.process_flow(f)\n  File \"/home/martin/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\", line 43, in process_flow\n    f.intercept()\n  File \"/home/martin/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 172, in intercept\n    self.reply.take()\n  File \"/home/martin/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 92, in take\n    \"Reply is {}, but expected it to be start.\".format(self.state)\nmitmproxy.exceptions.ControlException: Reply is taken, but expected it to be start.\n```\n\nThe issue is that there's a problem with the Interceptor addon. When `f.intercept()` is called, it tries to call `reply.take()` on line 172 in the flow's intercept method, but the state of the reply is \"taken\" when it expected \"start\".\n\nLooking at the code, I can see:\n\n1. In `mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py`, the `process_flow` method calls `f.intercept()` when certain conditions are met.\n2. The `f.intercept()` method is coming from `mitmproxy/flow.py` (not shown in the code segments) but it seems to be calling the controller's `take()` method.\n3. In `mitmproxy/controller.py`, the `take()` method of the `Reply` class checks if the state is \"start\", and raises an exception if it's not.\n\nLooking at the ASGI app code in `mitmproxy/addons/asgiapp.py`, I see that when serving an ASGI app, it does:\n\n```python\nasync def serve(app, flow: http.HTTPFlow):\n    \"\"\"\n    Serves app on flow.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert flow.reply\n\n    scope = make_scope(flow)\n    done = asyncio.Event()\n    received_body = False\n\n    async def receive():\n        nonlocal received_body\n        if not received_body:\n            received_body = True\n            return {\n                \"type\": \"http.request\",\n                \"body\": flow.request.raw_content,\n            }\n        else:  # pragma: no cover\n            # We really don't\n```\n\nThe code appears to be handling the initial HTTP request but is likely mid-implementation, with an incomplete error handling mechanism. The context suggests focusing on the REPLY_NOT_FOUND scenario or tracking the state of the HTTP request processing.\n\nThe Interceptor's filtering logic seems designed to conditionally intercept HTTP requests based on specific filter criteria. It checks if an interception filter exists, evaluates the flow against those filter conditions, and determines whether to take action on the request.\n\nThe key observation is the nuanced state management in the `take()` method, which relates to how HTTP replies are processed during request interception.\n\nI'll need to trace how the `has_message` flag interacts with request and response handling to understand potential synchronization issues between user-defined filters and the built-in interception mechanism.\n\nThe ASGI app's `f.reply.has_message` check seems potentially unreliable, potentially allowing unintended request interception due to incomplete parsing. This could create conflicts with any custom filter settings.\n\nThe interception process involves multiple steps: `request()` and `response()` handlers calling `process_flow()`, which evaluates filters and potentially calls `f.intercept()`. The state management of `flow.reply` appears critical to preventing premature or unnecessary interception.\n\nI need to carefully examine how the `take()` method manages these reply states to ensure robust request handling.\nI notice a discrepancy in the condition checks for option updates. The first condition correctly verifies if \"intercept\" is in the updated options, while the second incorrectly checks \"intercept_active\" instead. This suggests a potential configuration validation error that could lead to incorrect interception behavior.\n\nThe proposed fix corrects the second condition to directly check for \"intercept\" in the updated options, ensuring accurate option tracking and potential interception activation.\n\n'request' method filters flows using a custom condition. It checks if a filter exists, applies the filter to the flow, and ensures non-replay requests are intercepted when the interceptor is active. The method triggers interception when specific criteria are met, potentially modifying the flow's handling.\n\nThe implementation reveals potential nuanced interactions between flow types - distinguishing between standard requests and special applications like ASGI. The mechanism suggests a targeted approach to intercepting specific traffic while maintaining flexibility for different routing scenarios.\n\nThe code hints at a sophisticated routing mechanism where packets can be selectively managed based on destination, conditions, and existing reply state. Tracing the interception logic requires careful examination of the flow's state and potential modification points.\n\nThe `take()` method's implementation suggests a careful state validation process, ensuring that requests are handled precisely when the controller checks specific flow attributes. This implies a nuanced control flow where interception depends on multiple criteria beyond simple state transitions.\n\nI see a potential complexity in how flow attachments and interception mechanisms are designed, with subtle interactions between request handling and state management.\n\nThe flow from synchronous to asynchronous contexts creates an interesting synchronization challenge where reply handling might occur in different execution frameworks, potentially causing unexpected state conflicts.\n\nWhen `serve` is invoked as a non-`take()` action, the flow should naturally progress without incorrectly modifying the reply state. The asynchronous event creation seems designed to handle interception smoothly, suggesting a need for careful state management to prevent unintended reply manipulation during asynchronous processing.\n\nThe core concern emerges around potential race conditions between non-taken interception actions and reply state transitions, which could introduce complexity in asynchronous HTTP request handling.\n\nThe asymmetric code paths between request and response handlers hint at potential interception inconsistencies that might trigger unexpected reply state modifications.\n\nThe critical observation centers on the interaction between `has_message` and `intercept_active` during request and response events. An uninitialized filter could incorrectly allow intercepted flows, creating unpredictable behavior where flow interruptions don't match explicit interception intentions.\n\nThe core problem emerges from how request and response flows process interception conditions differently, potentially creating unintended flow interruptions when filters remain unset.\n\nInvestigating the initialization reveals initialization mechanisms vary between request and response asynchronous paths, suggesting potential race conditions or state management challenges in the interception logic.\n\nThe core issue seems to stem from flow object state inconsistencies where some flows might have message-related flags unset, causing unexpected interception behaviors. Specifically, request flows lacking proper message handling could trigger unintended interception mechanisms.\n\nWithout full visibility into the source code, the complexity appears centered on how flow messages are initially processed and when interception decisions are made.\n\nA potential solution involves carefully synchronizing flow state and ensuring that only fully processed requests undergo interception, particularly in the API gateway's request processing stage.\n\nThe core problem appears to be implicit request assumptions, where the ASGI application might make handling requests that don't align with expected client interaction patterns. Investigating how requests are intercepted and routed could reveal nuanced interaction challenges.\n\nExamining the routing mechanism reveals potential mismatches between actual and intended request semantics, suggesting a need for more precise request validation and handling strategies.\n\nThe proposed code modification introduces a more robust filtering mechanism, distinguishing between request and response scenarios while maintaining flow control integrity.\n\nI need to carefully validate the `flow.filter` existence before attempting interception. The current implementation assumes `flow.filter` is always set, which might not hold true for all request types. A safer approach would involve explicit conditional checks that prevent premature or erroneous interception attempts.\n\nThe nuanced logic suggests removing the `all()` aggregation for the filter check, ensuring each flow type receives appropriate handling.\n\nMy strategy focuses on creating a more robust mechanism that prevents unintended flow manipulation while maintaining the core filtering intent.\n\nI'm recognizing a potential synchronization problem between ASGI request and response objects. The current implementation might inadvertently create incorrect message states by calling `take` and `has_message` checks across different object types.\n\nThe key insight is developing a conditional path that ensures only specific flow types are intercepted, particularly API gateway requests. This requires carefully distinguishing between normal requests and specialized application flows to prevent unintended message state changes.\n\nThe proposed solution involves creating a targeted interception strategy that respects the unique characteristics of different flow types, ensuring consistent and predictable message handling.\n\nI'm exploring a potential solution to the flow interception logic. The key might be carefully managing how `ctx.options.intercept_active` gets set during different request processing stages. \n\nI'm considering how to create a flow-specific interception check that prevents conflicts between normal requests and API gateway flows. The goal is to establish a condition that ensures requests are treated appropriately without disrupting the main request processing mechanism.\n\nThe `service` function looks promising as a potential block point for preventing unintended interception across different request types.\n\nI see a potential synchronization issue in the flow handling. The problem seems to arise from misaligned request and response objects during interception. When a request flow gets intercepted, there might be a race condition where the response flow isn't properly prepared.\n\nThe key observation is that the `tcp_message` method might not correctly distinguish between different flow types, potentially causing unexpected interception behavior. This suggests we need a more robust mechanism for matching requests and responses during ASGI application communication.\n\nThe flow object's properties like `reply` and `is_replay` appear critical in determining how these interactions are managed. Further investigation into the `flowfilter` logic and request/response object initialization could reveal the root cause of the intermittent interception problem.\n\nI'm exploring a potential solution for managing request flow interception in the ASGI adapter. The key might be ensuring proper initialization and synchronization of flow objects between the API Gateway and request handling.\n\nThe current approach needs careful consideration to prevent unintended request interception and maintain consistent flow object states. Conditional checking could help resolve the underlying complexity in the `process_flow` method.\n\nMy focus is on understanding how `ctx.options.intercept` interacts with ASGI application requests to provide a more targeted interception mechanism.\n\nI see a potential synchronization problem with request flow interception. The core issue involves mismatched request and response handling during the ASGI process, particularly in the `request()` method where timing and flow management become critical. The current approach lacks proper lifecycle control, potentially leaving request objects in an inconsistent state when interception mechanisms are triggered.\n\nThe proposed solution needs careful modification of the interception logic, focusing on establishing a more robust request flow handling mechanism that ensures consistent object states and prevents premature or incorrect interception.\n\nCorrelation IDs and message passing through the `Channel` class offer a promising approach to managing thread-safe flow synchronization across different interleaved asynchronous operations.\n\nI'm exploring conditional interception scenarios that distinguish between standard client requests and API gateway internal communications. The core challenge involves preventing unnecessary route object processing while maintaining correct firewall message passing.\n\nThe key insight is understanding how internal messaging flows should be treated, ensuring routing objects are appropriately bypassed without disrupting underlying packet transmission logic.\n\nTwo potential approaches emerge for handling specialized request routing, each with nuanced implications for flow interception and network interaction patterns.\n</think>\nLooking at the issue, the problem is that the Interceptor addon is incorrectly trying to intercept incoming ASGI/WSGI requests, which should be handled internally without going through the addons processing chain.\n\nThe issue occurs in the `process_flow` method in the `Intercept` addon. The code is calling `self.filt = flowfilter.parse(ctx.options.intercept)` and then using this filter to determine whether to intercept requests, but there's already a check for this condition earlier in the same method:\n\n```python\nif self.filt:\n    should_intercept = all([\n        self.filt(f),\n        not f.is_replay == \"request\",\n    ])\n```\n\nWhen ASGI requests arrive, `self.filt` might be None (since `ctx.options.intercept` isn't set for internal API Gateway traffic), causing the condition to be evaluated as false and preventing actual interception. However, the subsequent call to `f.intercept()` still occurs because `self.filt` could be set from previous actions or be None but still truthy in some other edge case.\n\nThe fix is to ensure that API Gateway requests (to specific internal hosts/ports) are not passed through the addons interception logic, since they need to be handled internally by the ASGI application.\n\n```python\n### mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def process_flow(self, f):\n        if self.filt:\n            should_intercept = all([\n                self.filt(f),\n                not f.is_replay == \"request\",\n            ])\n            if should_intercept and ctx.options.intercept_active:\n                f.intercept()\n=======\n    def process_flow(self, f):\n        # Don't spy on API Gateway requests to internal hosts/ports\n        # These should be handled internally by the ASGI application\n        if f.request.pretty_host and f.request.port and f.request.pretty_host.endswith(\".internal\"):\n            return\n        \n        if self.filt:\n            should_intercept = all([\n                self.filt(f),\n                not f.is_replay == \"request\",\n            ])\n            if should_intercept and ctx.options.intercept_active:\n                f.intercept()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis fix:\n\n1. **Adds a missing check for API Gateway requests**: Before any interception logic, it checks if the flow is going to an internal API Gateway host (this could be extended to support specific patterns or hostnames).\n\n2. **Prevents the real interception logic from running**: This ensures that internal API Gateway requests never enter the addons processing chain where they could cause conflicts or errors.\n\n3. **Safeguards against `self.filt` being truthy without proper configuration**: Some flows might have `self.filt` set to a non-None value from previous actions (like directive binding), and this check prevents those from affecting internal API Gateway traffic.\n\nThe fix ensures that requests to internal API Gateway hosts/ports are processed internally by the ASGI application without going through the addons interception mechanism, preventing the error described in the issue., query_id: swe_mitmproxy__mitmproxy__4177, reward: [0]"], "extra_info": {"instance_id": "mitmproxy__mitmproxy__4177", "token_length": 3294, "context_type": "agentless_plus_pr", "gold_patches": "{\"mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\": \"diff --git a/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py b/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\\nindex 38e325c5de..5eebd6dc05 100644\\n--- a/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\\n+++ b/mitmproxy/addons/intercept.py\\n@@ -1,20 +1,18 @@\\n import typing\\n \\n-from mitmproxy import flowfilter\\n+from mitmproxy import flow, flowfilter\\n from mitmproxy import exceptions\\n from mitmproxy import ctx\\n \\n \\n class Intercept:\\n-    def __init__(self):\\n-        self.filt = None\\n+    filt: typing.Optional[flowfilter.TFilter] = None\\n \\n     def load(self, loader):\\n         loader.add_option(\\n             \\\"intercept_active\\\", bool, False,\\n             \\\"Intercept toggle\\\"\\n         )\\n-\\n         loader.add_option(\\n             \\\"intercept\\\", typing.Optional[str], None,\\n             \\\"Intercept filter expression.\\\"\\n@@ -22,25 +20,29 @@ def load(self, loader):\\n \\n     def configure(self, updated):\\n         if \\\"intercept\\\" in updated:\\n-            if not ctx.options.intercept:\\n+            if ctx.options.intercept:\\n+                self.filt = flowfilter.parse(ctx.options.intercept)\\n+                if not self.filt:\\n+                    raise exceptions.OptionsError(f\\\"Invalid interception filter: {ctx.options.intercept}\\\")\\n+                ctx.options.intercept_active = True\\n+            else:\\n                 self.filt = None\\n                 ctx.options.intercept_active = False\\n-                return\\n-            self.filt = flowfilter.parse(ctx.options.intercept)\\n-            if not self.filt:\\n-                raise exceptions.OptionsError(\\n-                    \\\"Invalid interception filter: %s\\\" % ctx.options.intercept\\n-                )\\n-            ctx.options.intercept_active = True\\n-\\n-    def process_flow(self, f):\\n-        if self.filt:\\n-            should_intercept = all([\\n-                self.filt(f),\\n-                not f.is_replay == \\\"request\\\",\\n-            ])\\n-            if should_intercept and ctx.options.intercept_active:\\n-                f.intercept()\\n+\\n+    def should_intercept(self, f: flow.Flow) -> bool:\\n+        return bool(\\n+                ctx.options.intercept_active\\n+                and self.filt\\n+                and self.filt(f)\\n+                and not f.is_replay\\n+        )\\n+\\n+    def process_flow(self, f: flow.Flow) -> None:\\n+        if self.should_intercept(f):\\n+            assert f.reply\\n+            if f.reply.state != \\\"start\\\":\\n+                return ctx.log.debug(\\\"Cannot intercept request that is already taken by another addon.\\\")\\n+            f.intercept()\\n \\n     #
