{"prompt": "<\uff5cUser\uff5c>\nBaron Munchausen told a story. \"There were a whole crowd of us. We reached a crossroads. Then half of our group turned left, a third turned right, and a fifth went straight.\" \"But wait, the Duke remarked, the sum of half, a third, and a fifth isn't equal to one, so you are lying!\" The Baron replied, \"I'm not lying, I'm rounding. For example, there are 17 people. I say that a third turned. Should one person split in your opinion? No, with rounding, six people turned. From whole numbers, the closest to the fraction $17 / 3$ is 6. And if I say that half of the 17 people turned, it means 8 or 9 people.\" It is known that Baron Munchausen never lies.
