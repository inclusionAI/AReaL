The user, John Smith, is having trouble sending MMS messages. He mentioned he's in France and has a phone number. The first thing I need to do is check if there are any issues with his cellular service or data settings.\n\nSince he's in France, data roaming might be an issue. The tool 'enable_roaming' could be relevant here. But I need to check if the line is already roaming enabled. Wait, the user hasn't mentioned the line status yet. Maybe I should first check if the line is suspended or if roaming is enabled.\n\nLooking at the tools, there's 'get_customer_by_phone' which uses the phone number to find the customer. That's a good start. Let me call that function with his phone number: 555-123-2002. Once I have the customer's details, I can check their line status and roaming settings.\n\nIf the line is suspended, I need to check the reason. If it's due to an overdue bill, I should remind him to pay it. Alternatively, if roaming isn't enabled, I should enable it. But since he's in France, maybe the line isn't roaming enabled, so I need to use 'enable_roaming' on his line.\n\nAnother thing to check is the APN settings. The 'check_apn_settings' tool can show if the MMSC URL is correct. If it's missing or incorrect, resetting the APN might help. But I need to call that tool first to see the status.\n\nAlso, the user's MMS might be failing because of network settings. The 'set_network_mode_preference' could be used to switch to 4G/5G if the current mode is 2G. But I should check the current network mode first.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are: \n\n1. Use get_customer_by_phone to find John's customer details.\n2. Check the line status and roaming status.\n3. Check APN settings for MMSC URL.\n4.

The user is having trouble sending MMS messages. They mentioned they're in France and the phone number is 555-123-2002. The agent has already called get_customer_by_phone and get_line_details, and checked the line status, roaming status. Now, the next step is to check if the line is suspended or if roaming is enabled.\n\nWait, the user's line status might be suspended, which would prevent service. Or maybe roaming is disabled. The agent needs to check if the line is active. If it's suspended, they need to resume it. Also, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nThe previous tools called were check_line_status, check_roaming_status. The user's line status might be Suspended, so the agent should suspend the line if necessary. But according to the policy, the agent can only lift suspension if the user pays overdue bills. But the user hasn't mentioned overdue bills. So maybe the line is suspended due to contract end date, but the agent can't lift it. But the agent needs to check if the line is suspended. \n\nAlternatively, if the line is active, check APN settings. If APN is incorrect, reset it. Also, check if data roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nSo the next steps would be: check line status, check roaming status, then take actions based on those results. If line is suspended, resume it.

If all that fails, maybe the user needs to reboot the device or check for software updates. Since the user is in France, maybe there's a roaming issue, but the agent already checked that. The next action should be to guide the user through these steps and see if any of them resolve the problem.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"check_network_mode_preference\", \"arguments\": {\"customer_id\": \"C1001\"}}\n</tool_call>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150214,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":303,"prompt_tokens":8116,"total_tokens":8419,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}}],"task":{"id":"[mms_issue]airplane_mode_on|bad_network_preference|break_apn_mms_setting|break_app_both_permissions|data_mode_off|data_usage_exceeded|user_abroad_roaming_enabled_off[PERSONA:None]","description":{"purpose":"Test resolution path: MMS (Picture/Group Messaging) Issues.","relevant_policies":null,"notes":null},"user_scenario":{"persona":null,"instructions":{"domain":"telecom","reason_for_call":"You are unable to send MMS messages using your messaging app for the past few hours.
