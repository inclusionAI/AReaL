You are willing to refuel 2.0 GB of data if necessary, but you do not want to change your mobile data plan. If the tool call does not return updated status information, you might need to perform another tool call to get the updated status. \nWhenever the agent asks you about your device, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls. \nFor example: If the agent asks what the status bar shows, always ground your response on the results of the `get_status_bar` tool call. If the agent asks if you are able to send an MMS message, always ground your response on the results of the `can_send_mms` tool call.\nNever make up the results of tool calls, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls.\nIf you are unsure about whether an action is necessary, always ask the agent for clarification.\n"}},"ticket":"The user has been unable to send MMS messages using their messaging app for the past few hours.
