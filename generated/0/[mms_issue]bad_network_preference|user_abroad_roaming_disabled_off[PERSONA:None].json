The user, John Smith, is in France and has been having trouble sending MMS messages. He mentioned that his messaging app isn't working. I need to figure out what's causing this.\n\nFirst, I should check the policies. The user's issue is related to MMS, which is covered under the tech support policy. The tools available include checking APN settings, data roaming, and network mode preferences. \n\nSince the user is in France, data roaming might be an issue. The policy mentions that if the line is not roaming enabled, the user can't use data outside their home network. So I should check if the line is roaming enabled. \n\nThe tools available include 'enable_roaming' and 'disable_roaming'. But the user isn't asking to enable or disable roaming; they're having trouble sending MMS. So maybe the APN settings are wrong. The 'check_apn_settings' function can be used to see if the MMSC URL is correct. \n\nAlso, the user's phone might be on a 2G network, which isn't suitable for MMS. The 'set_network_mode_preference' function could be used to switch to a 3G or higher network. \n\nAnother thing is that MMS requires the correct APN settings. If the MMSC URL is missing or incorrect, the user can't send messages. So resetting the APN settings might help. \n\nI should also check if the user's data is being used properly. If data is limited, refueling might be needed, but that's for data usage, not MMS. \n\nThe user might not have the necessary permissions for the messaging app. Granting permissions could be a step, but the tools here include 'grant_app_permission' for the messaging app. \n\nSo the steps I should take are: check APN settings, check network mode, enable roaming if needed, and check if the user has the necessary permissions. Since the user is in France, maybe the line isn't roaming enabled, so enabling it could be a solution. \n\nBut the user hasn't mentioned the line's status. I need to check if the line is suspended or if there are other issues. However, the user's main issue is MMS, so focusing on that first. \n\nI should start by checking the APN settings. If they're incorrect, resetting them might fix the problem. Then check the network mode preference to ensure it's not on 2G. If the network is 2G, switching to 3G or 4G could help. Also, ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions for the messaging app. \n\nSo the first tool call would be to check the APN settings. If that's not the issue, then check the network mode. If the network is 2G, switch to 3G. Also, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided specific details about their phone's settings.

If the agent asks if you are able to send an MMS message, always ground your response on the results of the `can_send_mms` tool call.\nNever make up the results of tool calls, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls.\nIf you are unsure about whether an action is necessary, always ask the agent for clarification.\n"}},"ticket":"The user has been unable to send MMS messages using their messaging app for the past few hours.
