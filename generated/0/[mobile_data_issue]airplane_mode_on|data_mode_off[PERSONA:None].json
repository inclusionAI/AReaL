The user is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. He's having issues with his mobile data, either stopping or being slow. He needs excellent internet speed and can't use Wi-Fi. I need to help him fix this.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a tool to get customer details. The get_customer_by_phone function can retrieve customer info using their phone number. Let me call that. The parameters require the phone number, which the user provided. So I'll use get_customer_by_phone with the phone number 555-123-2002.\n\nOnce I have the customer's information, I can check their lines. Maybe the line is suspended or has issues. The suspend_line function can check if the line is suspended. But first, I need the customer ID from the get_customer_by_phone response. Wait, the tool response will give the customer ID, right? So I'll need to process that.\n\nAfter retrieving the customer, I should check if their line is active. If it's suspended, I can try to resume it. But the user mentioned mobile data issues, so maybe the line is suspended, leading to no service. Alternatively, check if mobile data is enabled. Use check_network_status to see if mobile data is on or off.\n\nIf the mobile data is off, toggle_data to enable it. If the user is abroad and roaming is off, enable roaming with enable_roaming. Also, check APN settings for MMS. If the APN is incorrect, reset it. But the user's main issue is mobile data speed and connectivity.\n\nWait, the user hasn't mentioned a specific bill being overdue, so maybe that's not the issue. But the policy says to check for overdue bills if needed. However, the user's main problem is mobile data, so focus on that.\n\nSo first, call get_customer_by_phone. Then, check the customer's lines. If a line is suspended, resume it. Then check mobile data status. If it's off, enable it. Also, check APN settings. If MMS is causing issues, fix that. But the user's main issue is mobile data speed and connectivity.\n\nAnother thing: the user mentioned needing excellent speed, so maybe the line is on 2G, which is slow. So adjust the network mode preference to 4G/5G. Use set_network_mode_preference with \"4g_5g_preferred\".\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get customer details using phone number.\n2. Check if any lines are suspended. If so, resume them.\n3. Check mobile data status. If off, enable it.\n4. Check APN settings. If incorrect, reset them.\n5. Adjust network mode preference to 4G/5G.\n6. Check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it.\n7. Ensure the user has the necessary app permissions for MMS.\n\nBut the user's main issue is mobile data, so prioritize those steps. The tools available include check_network_status, toggle_data, enable_roaming, set_network_mode_preference, etc.\n\nSo first, call get_customer_by_phone with the phone number.
