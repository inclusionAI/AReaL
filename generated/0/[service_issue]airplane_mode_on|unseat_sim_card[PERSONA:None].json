However, the customer's account status is Active, so maybe the lines are active.

The bills are B1001, B1002, B1003. Let me check if any of those bills are overdue. The bills are in the system, but the user hasn't mentioned any overdue bills. However, the system might have them. But the user's issue is 'No Service', which could be due to network issues, APN settings, or data roaming.\n\nI should check the line's data usage.

But the customer's account status is Active, so maybe the lines are okay. Alternatively, check if the line is roaming enabled. If not, the user might not be able to use data outside their coverage area.\n\nAlso, check if the APN settings are correct. If the MMSC URL is missing or incorrect, MMS might not work, but the user's issue is 'No Service', which could be broader. Since the user hasn't mentioned MMS issues, maybe it's a general network problem.\n\nSince the customer's account is active and the lines are active, the next step is to check if any bills are overdue.

So I need to check if the APN is correct. But since the user's issue is 'No Service', maybe the APN is wrong. Alternatively, data roaming might be disabled.

The user might need to enable roaming if they're abroad.\n\nBut since the user hasn't mentioned being abroad, perhaps the issue is with the network settings.

Since the account is active, the lines are active, but maybe the APN is wrong. So the assistant should inform the user to check their APN settings and data roaming.
