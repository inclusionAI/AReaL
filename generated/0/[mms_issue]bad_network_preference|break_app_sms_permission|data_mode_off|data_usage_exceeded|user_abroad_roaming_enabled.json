The user, John Smith, is in France and has trouble sending MMS messages. He mentioned that his messaging app isn't working. I need to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any issues with his cellular service or mobile data. Since he's in France, maybe data roaming is a factor. The user might not have data roaming enabled, which is why his MMS isn't working. But I need to confirm that.\n\nLooking at the tools available, there's a function called enable_roaming and disable_roaming. Also, there's check_apn_settings and reset_apn_settings. Maybe the APN settings are incorrect. The user might need to reset them if they're not set correctly.\n\nAnother thing is the network mode preference. If his phone is on a 2G network, MMS might not work. The function set_network_mode_preference can be used to switch to 4G or 5G. But I should check if that's necessary.\n\nAlso, the user might have a SIM card issue. Checking the SIM status with check_sim_status could help. If the SIM is locked or missing, that's another problem. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's not the issue.\n\nThe MMS functionality depends on the APN settings. The MMSC URL is important. If the APN settings are incorrect, the user can reset them. So, using reset_apn_settings might fix it.\n\nSince the user is in France, data roaming might be required. If the line isn't roaming enabled, he can't use mobile data outside his home network. So, enabling roaming could be a step.\n\nI should start by checking the APN settings. If they're wrong, reset them. Then, check if the network mode is set to 4G. If not, change it. Also, ensure that data roaming is enabled. If the line isn't roaming, that's another issue.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are: check APN settings, reset if needed, check network mode, enable roaming if necessary.
