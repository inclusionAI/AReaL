The user is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. He's in France and his mobile data isn't working or is very slow. He needs excellent internet speed and can't use Wi-Fi. I need to help him fix this.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a tool to get customer details. The available tools include get_customer_by_phone, which uses the phone number. Since he provided his phone number, I can use that to find his customer information. That might help determine if there's a roaming issue or if his line is suspended.\n\nNext, I should check his mobile data status. The tools include check_network_status, which can show if mobile data is enabled and the connection quality. But since the user mentioned he's in France, maybe the roaming settings are an issue. The enable_roaming function could be useful here to check if roaming is enabled.\n\nAlso, the user might have a line that's suspended, which could affect service. The suspend_line function could be used if the line is suspended, but I need to confirm that first. However, the user hasn't mentioned a suspension yet, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother thing is the APN settings. If the APN is incorrect, that could cause issues. The reset_apn_settings function might be needed, but I need to check if that's the root cause.\n\nSince the user is in France, I should check if the line is roaming enabled. If not, enabling roaming could help. The enable_roaming function would be appropriate here.\n\nI should also check if mobile data is turned off. The toggle_data function could be used to turn it on if it's disabled. But the user mentioned he can't use Wi-Fi, so mobile data is the only option.\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided his customer ID or any other details. The get_customer_by_phone function would need his phone number to retrieve the customer info. So first, I should call get_customer_by_phone with the phone number 555-123-2002 to get his customer details.\n\nOnce I have the customer info, I can check if the line is suspended, if roaming is enabled, and if APN settings are correct. Then, based on that, suggest the necessary actions. If the line is suspended, I might need to lift the suspension, but according to the policy, I can only lift it if the contract end date is not in the past. If that's the case, I should inform him to pay the overdue bills first.\n\nAlso, checking the data usage to see if it's over the limit. If so, refueling might be needed. The refuel_data function could be used here if the data is over the limit.\n\nSo the steps would be: first, get the customer info using the phone number. Then check network status, roaming status, APN settings, and data usage. Based on that, suggest enabling roaming, checking APN, and ensuring mobile data is on.
