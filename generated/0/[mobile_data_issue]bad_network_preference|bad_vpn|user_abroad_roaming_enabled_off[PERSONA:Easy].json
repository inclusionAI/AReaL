The user is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. He's in France and his mobile data isn't working or is very slow. He needs help fixing it.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a tool that can help with mobile data issues. Looking at the tools provided, there's 'enable_roaming' and 'disable_roaming' functions. Since he's in France, maybe roaming is enabled but not working. But the user might not know that. Wait, the tool to enable roaming is available. But first, I need to check if the line is already roaming. However, the tools don't have a function to check roaming status. The 'get_data_usage' function could show if the line is roaming enabled. But the user hasn't provided the line ID or customer ID. \n\nThe user hasn't provided a customer ID or line ID, so I can't call functions that require those. The 'get_customer_by_phone' function can find the customer by phone number. Let's try that first. The phone number is 555-123-2002. Using 'get_customer_by_phone' with the phone number. That would give me the customer's details, including their line information. \n\nOnce I have the customer's details, I can check if the line is suspended. If it's suspended, I need to resume it. But the user mentioned the line is in France, so maybe roaming is the issue. But without the line ID, I can't proceed. Wait, the 'get_customer_by_phone' function might return the customer's line IDs. If that's the case, I can then check the line's status and see if it's suspended or if roaming is enabled. \n\nSo first, I should call 'get_customer_by_phone' with the phone number. Then, use the customer ID to check the line details. If the line is suspended, I can try to resume it. Alternatively, check if roaming is enabled. But the user's issue is that data isn't working or is slow. Maybe the line isn't roaming enabled, so I need to enable it. \n\nBut the user is in France, so maybe the line isn't roaming enabled. The 'enable_roaming' function would be needed. However, without the customer and line IDs, I can't call that function. So first, I need to get the customer info to find the line. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Use 'get_customer_by_phone' to find John Smith's customer ID.\n2. Use the customer ID to get the lines associated with him.\n3. Check if any lines are suspended or if roaming is disabled.\n4. If roaming is disabled, enable it using 'enable_roaming'.\n5. Check if the data is now working. If not, maybe check other settings like APN or network mode.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the line ID, so I can't call 'enable_roaming' directly. So perhaps after getting the customer info, I can check the lines and see if any are suspended. If so, resume them. Also, check if roaming is enabled. \n\nAlternatively, if the line is active but roaming is disabled, enable it. But the user is in France, so maybe the line isn't roaming enabled, hence the issue. \n\nSo the first action is to get the customer info. Then, check the lines.
