The user is John Smith from France, his phone number is 555-123-2002. He's experiencing issues with his mobile data, it's not working properly or very slow. He needs excellent internet speed.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a tool that can help with mobile data issues. Looking at the provided tools, there's the 'enable_roaming' function, which allows enabling data roaming. Since he's in France, which is outside his home network, enabling roaming might be necessary. Also, there's 'check_network_status' which can show if roaming is enabled.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned his phone number, so maybe I should check if the line is already roaming. However, the tools don't have a direct way to check roaming status. The 'enable_roaming' function can be used to enable it. But first, I need to confirm if the line is active. If the line is suspended, I might need to suspend it first, but the user didn't mention that.\n\nWait, the user's problem is mobile data not working or being slow. Possible causes could be roaming not enabled, network settings, APN issues, or data plan limits. Since he's in France, roaming might be required. So, the first step would be to check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. Then check if the network mode is set to 4G/5G. If it's 2G, switch to 4G.\n\nAlso, check if the APN settings are correct. If the MMSC URL is missing, that could be an issue. But the 'check_apn_settings' tool can help verify that. If the APN is incorrect, resetting it might resolve the issue.\n\nAnother thing is data plan limits. If the user has used up their data, that could cause slowdowns. But the user hasn't mentioned data usage, so maybe that's not the issue here.\n\nSince the user is in France, maybe the line is not roaming enabled, so enabling it would be necessary. So, the steps would be: check roaming status, enable it if not already, check network mode, and maybe reset APN settings.\n\nBut the tools available include 'enable_roaming', 'set_network_mode_preference', 'reset_apn_settings', and 'check_network_status'. So, the plan would be to call 'enable_roaming' to enable roaming, then check the network status to see if that improves things. If not, maybe adjust the network mode to 4G/5G. Also, check APN settings and reset them if needed.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided their customer ID or line ID, so I can't directly call functions that require those. The 'get_customer_by_phone' function could be used to find the customer, but the user hasn't provided a customer ID. However, the policy says to use the tools provided, so maybe I need to check if the customer exists.\n\nWait, the user provided their phone number, so using 'get_customer_by_phone' with the phone number 555-123-2002. But the function's parameters require a phone number as a string. So, I can call that function to get the customer information. Once I have the customer, I can check their line status, APN settings, etc.\n\nBut the user's main issue is mobile data not working. So first, I should check if the customer's line is active. If it's suspended, I might need to suspend it, but the user didn't mention that. However, the policy says to check if the line is suspended and handle it accordingly. But since the user hasn't mentioned suspension, maybe it's active.\n\nSo, the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Use 'get_customer_by_phone' to find the customer with phone number 555-123-2002.\n2. Once the customer is retrieved, check their line status and APN settings.\n3. If roaming is not enabled, use 'enable_roaming' to enable it.\n4. Check network mode preferences and switch to 4G/5G if necessary.\n5. Check APN settings and reset them if needed.\n6. Check if data plan limits are causing issues and refuel data if necessary.\n7. Finally, check if the mobile data is working after these steps.\n\nBut since the user is in France, enabling roaming is a key step. So the first tool call should be to check if roaming is enabled. However, the available tools don't have a function to check roaming status directly. The 'enable_roaming' function can be called to enable it, but the user might need to confirm if it's already enabled.\n\nBut according to the policy, the agent should try to resolve the issue before transferring. So, the agent should first check if the line is active, then check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. Then check the network mode and APN settings.\n\nSo, the first tool call might be 'get_customer_by_phone' with the phone number provided.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Enabling Roaming**:  \n   Since you're in France, your line needs to be roaming-enabled to use data outside your home network. This allows your phone to access foreign data networks when needed.\n\n2. **Setting Network Mode Preference**:  \n   - **Why 4G/5G?** Modern networks (4G/5G) offer faster speeds (up to 100+ Mbps for 5G) compared to 2G/3G (usually 1-5 Mbps).  \n   - **Why not 2G/3G?** 2G/3G networks are outdated and **not suitable for MMS** (multimedia messaging). If your carrier doesn’t support MMS over 2G, this could prevent you from sending photos or videos.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Restart your phone to apply the changes.  \n- Check if data is now faster or clearer.  \n- If issues persist, we can troubleshoot further (e.g., APN settings, SIM card, or VPN).  \n\nLet me know if you need help with anything else! 📱🌍","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150181,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":448,"prompt_tokens":7651,"total_tokens":8099,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}},{"role":"user","content":"I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still a bit worried.

Also, checking if the SIM is active and the network mode is set correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the user might have a carrier-specific APN setting that's not default. But since they reset to default, that should be okay. Also, ensuring that the line is active and not suspended. But the user didn't mention any suspension issues, so probably not.\n\nSo, the next step is to check the network status again. If it's enabled, then the answer is positive. If not, maybe suggest checking the SIM card or APN again. But since the user has already reset APN, maybe the issue is resolved. But to be safe, check the status.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"check_network_status\", \"arguments\": {}}\n</tool_call>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150226,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":396,"prompt_tokens":8598,"total_tokens":8994,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}}],"task":{"id":"[mobile_data_issue]data_mode_off|data_usage_exceeded|user_abroad_roaming_disabled_off[PERSONA:Hard]","description":{"purpose":"Test resolution path: Mobile Data/Slow Internet Issues.","relevant_policies":null,"notes":null},"user_scenario":{"persona":"\nAt 64 years old, you're a retired librarian who keeps your phone use simple - mainly for calls, texts, and capturing photos of your grandchildren.
