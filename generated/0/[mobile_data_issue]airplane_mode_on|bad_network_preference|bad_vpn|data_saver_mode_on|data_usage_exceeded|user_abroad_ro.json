The user hasn't mentioned that, but maybe it's a factor. If data saver is on, that could be causing the slow speed.\n\nSo, the next steps would be to check if data saver is enabled.

But the user didn't mention suspension, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the data plan has limits. The user mentioned refueling data, but they didn't do that yet. The plan's data limit might be exceeded, causing connectivity issues. The agent should check data usage.\n\nSo, the next steps: check data usage to see if it's exceeded the plan's limit. If so, suggest refueling. Also, check if roaming is enabled, which it is. Maybe the user is in a area with poor 4G/5G coverage. But the agent has already tried setting the network mode to 4G/5G. Maybe the issue is with the carrier's network in France. But the user is in France, so maybe the carrier is down there. However, the agent can't access real-time carrier status, so they might need to suggest contacting customer support.\n\nAlternatively, the agent could check if the user has any other issues like SIM card problems, but the user hasn't mentioned that. The agent should proceed with the next possible steps. Since the speed test hasn't improved, perhaps the agent should check if the user needs to contact customer support for further assistance, or suggest a refund if the service is not working as expected. But according to the policy, the agent should try to resolve issues before transferring. So, the agent might need to inform the user that they can't resolve it on their own and suggest transferring to a human agent. But first, check if there's any other step they can take.\n</think>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_21d529ac02a9421485d67a8c","function":{"arguments":"{\"customer_id\": \"C1001\", \"line_id\": \"L1001\"}","name":"get_data_usage"},"type":"function"}]}}],"created":1769150219,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens":8369,"total_tokens":8913,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}}],"task":{"id":"[mobile_data_issue]airplane_mode_on|bad_network_preference|bad_vpn|data_saver_mode_on|data_usage_exceeded|user_abroad_roaming_enabled_off[PERSONA:None]","description":{"purpose":"Test resolution path: Mobile Data/Slow Internet Issues.","relevant_policies":null,"notes":null},"user_scenario":{"persona":null,"instructions":{"domain":"telecom","reason_for_call":"You mobile data is not working properly.
