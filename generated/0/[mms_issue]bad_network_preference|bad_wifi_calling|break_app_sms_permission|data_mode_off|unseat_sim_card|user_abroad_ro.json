The user, John Smith, is having trouble sending MMS messages. He mentioned it's been going on for hours and it won't work. I need to figure out how to help him.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a tool available to diagnose MMS issues. Looking at the tools provided, there's the 'can_send_mms' function. That seems relevant. But wait, the user didn't mention the phone model or any specific error messages. So maybe I need to guide him through checking basic settings first.\n\nThe tech support policy suggests using diagnostic actions like checking the status bar, network mode preferences, APN settings, and so on. Since the user is experiencing MMS issues, I should start by ensuring that the phone has proper cellular service and mobile data. \n\nI should also check if the APN settings are correct, as incorrect APN can block MMS. The 'check_apn_settings' tool can be used here. If the MMSC URL is missing or wrong, resetting the APN might solve it. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the network mode preference. If the phone is on 2G, that might not support MMS. The 'set_network_mode_preference' function can be used to switch to 4G or 5G, which are better for MMS. \n\nAlso, checking if the SIM card is working properly is important. If the SIM is locked or missing, that could be a problem. The 'check_sim_status' tool could help here. \n\nSince the user is having trouble sending MMS, I should also check if the messaging app has the necessary permissions. The 'grant_app_permission' function might be needed to grant storage and SMS permissions. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided any specific error messages or phone model.

Then, based on that info, guide him through the steps to fix the issue. \n\nWait, the instructions say to make one tool call at a time.

If the tool call does not return updated status information, you might need to perform another tool call to get the updated status. \nWhenever the agent asks you about your device, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls. \nFor example: If the agent asks what the status bar shows, always ground your response on the results of the `get_status_bar` tool call. If the agent asks if you are able to send an MMS message, always ground your response on the results of the `can_send_mms` tool call.\nNever make up the results of tool calls, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls.\nIf you are unsure about whether an action is necessary, always ask the agent for clarification.\n"}},"ticket":"The user has been unable to send MMS messages using their messaging app for the past few hours.
