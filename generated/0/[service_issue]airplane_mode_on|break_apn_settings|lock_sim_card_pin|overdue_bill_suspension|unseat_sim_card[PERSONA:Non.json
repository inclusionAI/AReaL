The user, John Smith, is facing a 'No Service' issue on his phone. He provided his phone number: 555-123-2002. My task is to help him figure out why his phone isn't showing service.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a customer record for John. The policy mentions using functions like get_customer_by_phone, get_customer_by_id, or get_customer_by_name. Since the user provided a phone number, I should start by looking up his customer information using the get_customer_by_phone function.\n\nThe function parameters require a phone number, which the user provided. So I'll call get_customer_by_phone with the phone number 555-123-2002. If the customer exists, I can proceed to troubleshoot. If not, maybe the user needs to check if the number is correct or if there's an issue with the account.\n\nOnce I have the customer details, I can check the line status. The user mentioned the phone showing 'No Service', which might be due to a suspended line, roaming issues, or APN problems. The tools available include checking the line status, APN settings, and roaming status.\n\nIf the customer is active, I need to check the network settings. The user might have airplane mode on, which would disable cellular service. Or maybe the APN settings are incorrect. The tools like check_network_status and check_apn_settings can help here.\n\nAlso, the user might have data limits exceeded, leading to service issues. The refuel_data function could be useful if the data usage is over the limit. But first, I need to confirm if the line is active and the data usage is within limits.\n\nIf the customer is suspended, the line status would be Suspended, and I would need to resume it. But the user hasn't mentioned any overdue bills, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nI should also check if the user has enabled roaming, which is necessary when they're outside the home network. If the line isn't roaming enabled, the phone might not work outside.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided their customer ID or any other details, the first step is to look up the customer using the phone number. If that's successful, proceed to check the line status and network settings.

The user is having trouble with their phone showing 'No Service' and 'Data Disabled'. They tried reseating the SIM card, but it didn't help. Now they're checking the network mode preference.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the network mode preference does. From the tech support policy, network mode preference affects which cellular network the phone connects to. If it's set to 2G, that might be the issue because MMS and some data services require 3G or higher. The user's line has a data limit of 5GB, but their usage is already at 0 for L1003, but L1001 used 3.2GB and L1002 used 8.7GB. Wait, that's over the limit for L1002, which is 15GB. But the data refueling is 0, so maybe the data was already used up.
