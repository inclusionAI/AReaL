The previous tool call to check APN settings returned that the MMSC URL is missing. Resetting the APN settings could resolve that. But the user is in France, so maybe the carrier's APN is different. However, the tool doesn't have information about the carrier, so I can't suggest specific APN names. \n\nThe user might need to reset the APN settings. The next step would be to guide them through resetting the APN settings. Also, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nAfter resetting APN, the user needs to reboot the device. Then, test MMS again. If that doesn't work, maybe check other settings like data mode or network preferences. \n\nI should also mention that if the problem persists, transferring to a human agent might be necessary. But since the user is asking for help, I should first try to resolve the APN and roaming issues step by step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"reset_apn_settings\", \"arguments\": {\"line_id\": \"L1001\"}}\n</tool_call>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150195,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":418,"prompt_tokens":8055,"total_tokens":8473,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}},{"role":"user","content":"I understand that this can be a bit overwhelming, John.
