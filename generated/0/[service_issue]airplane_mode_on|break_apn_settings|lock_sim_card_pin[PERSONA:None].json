The user's account status is Active, but maybe the line's contract end date is in the past. The policy says that if the contract end date is in the past, the line can't be resumed even if the user paid the overdue bill. So if the line's contract end date is in the past, the user can't resume it, and they need to contact support.\n\nWait, the user's account status is Active, but the line's contract end date might be in the past. Let me check the line details. The user's line IDs are L1001, L1002, L1003. The line L1002 has a suspension fee, but the contract end date is not provided. The policy says that if the line's contract end date is in the past, the line can't be resumed even if the user paid the overdue bill. So if the line's contract end date is in the past, the user can't resume it, and they need to contact support.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the contract end date for the line. The system might not have that info. So maybe I need to check the line details to see if the contract end date is in the past. If it is, then the line can't be resumed, and the user needs to contact support. Otherwise, the line should be active.\n\nSo the next step is to check the line status to see if it's suspended or not. If it's still suspended, the user needs to pay the suspension fee or contact support. If it's active, then the service should be restored.\n\nTherefore, I should call the get_line_details function to check the status of the line. If the line is still suspended, then the user needs to contact support. Otherwise, the service should be restored.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"get_line_details\", \"arguments\": {\"line_id\": \"L1002\"}}\n</tool_call>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150216,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":755,"prompt_tokens":9154,"total_tokens":9909,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}},{"role":"user","content":"I see that the line L1002 is now active, but your phone is still showing 'No Service.'
