However, the line's contract end date isn't mentioned, so maybe it's active. \n\nWait, the user mentioned data speed is very slow. Possible reasons: network mode preference is 2G, which is slow. The set_network_mode_preference function can change it to 4G/5G. But I need to check the current network mode preference. However, the tools available don't include checking network mode preference directly. The check_network_mode_preference function is part of the tech support tools, but I don't have that in the current tools list. Wait, looking back, the tech support tools include check_network_mode_preference, but in the initial tools provided, it's not listed. Wait, the user provided the tools section, and in the tools, the functions are listed. Let me check again.\n\nThe tools listed include functions like check_status_bar, check_network_status, etc. But the set_network_mode_preference is a fix action. However, the user's current tools don't include a function to check the network mode preference. So maybe I can't directly check that. But the user's issue is about data speed, so maybe the network mode is 2G. To fix that, I need to guide the user to change the network mode preference. But since I can't call a function to check that, maybe I should proceed to enable roaming first, then check the network mode.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to enable roaming if it's not already enabled. So first, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. Then, check the network mode preference. If it's 2G, change it to 4G/5G. But since I can't call a function to check the network mode preference, maybe I can suggest adjusting the network mode preference based on the current status.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to enable roaming first. So the next step is to check if roaming is enabled for their line. If not, enable it. Then, check the network mode preference. If it's 2G, change it.

So perhaps I can use check_network_status to see the current network type. If it's 2G, then proceed to change the network mode preference.\n\nSo the plan is: first, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. Then check the network status. If it's 2G, change the network mode preference to 4G/5G. Then check if data is working.

If not, maybe suggest refueling, but the user's issue is speed, not data limit.\n\nSo the tool calls would be:\n\n- Check if roaming is enabled using enable_roaming or check_network_status. But the tools don't have a direct function to check roaming status. Wait, the user's tools include 'enable_roaming' and 'disable_roaming', which are functions to enable/disable roaming. So maybe call enable_roaming to check if it's enabled.\n\nWait, the user's tools include 'enable_roaming' and 'disable_roaming' functions. So to check if roaming is enabled, maybe call enable_roaming and see the response. But the function 'enable_roaming' takes customer_id and line_id. Since the customer_id is C1001 and line_ids are L1001, L1002, L1003, I need to check each line. But the user's issue is with mobile data, so maybe check the line with L1001 first.\n\nBut the user's problem is with mobile data in France, so maybe the line is not roaming enabled. So enable roaming for the line. Then check the network status. If it's 2G, change the network mode preference.\n\nSo the next step is to call enable_roaming for the line.
