The user, John Smith, is having trouble sending MMS messages. He mentioned his phone number is 555-123-2002 and he's in the US. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a customer record for him. The tools available include get_customer_by_phone, which can find a customer using their phone number. So I should call that function with his phone number. \n\nOnce I have the customer details, I can check if there are any issues with their line or data settings. The user might have a problem with the APN settings, which are crucial for MMS. The tools also include check_apn_settings, but I need to first get the customer info.\n\nIf the customer exists, I should look into their line's status. If the line is suspended, that could be a problem. Also, check if data roaming is enabled, since that's necessary for MMS. If the line isn't roaming enabled, the user can't send MMS while outside their home network, but since he's in the US, maybe that's not the issue.\n\nAnother possibility is the APN settings. The user might have incorrect MMSC URL, which is part of the APN settings. The tools can check that. Also, check if mobile data is enabled and if the network mode is set to a higher speed, like 4G or 5G, which is needed for MMS.\n\nIf the customer's data is limited and they've used up their plan, that could be another issue.
