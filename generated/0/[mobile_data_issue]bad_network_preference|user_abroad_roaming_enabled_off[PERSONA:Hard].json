He's in France, his phone number is 555-123-2002, and his mobile data isn't working properly. The problem is that his data is either stopping or very slow. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a tool available to diagnose his mobile data issues. Looking at the tools provided, there's a function called check_network_status which can show the network status, including signal strength and whether mobile data is enabled. Also, there's a function to check APN settings, which is important for mobile data connectivity. \n\nSince John is in France, I should check if his line is roaming enabled. The enable_roaming function can be used to check if roaming is enabled. If it's not, he might need to enable it. But first, I need to confirm if his line is already roaming. \n\nAnother thing to check is his network mode preference. If his phone is set to 2G/3G, that could be a problem since MMS requires 3G. The set_network_mode_preference function can be used to switch to 4G/5G. \n\nAlso, the APN settings might be incorrect. The check_apn_settings function can verify if the MMSC URL is set correctly. If it's not, resetting the APN settings might help. \n\nI should start by checking the current network status and APN settings. If the data is disabled, I can enable it. If the APN is wrong, reset it. Also, check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. Then, adjust the network mode preference to 4G/5G. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that his mobile data is slow. Maybe the data plan is low, so refueling data could help. But first, check if the data usage is already at the limit. The get_data_usage function can retrieve the current data usage. If it's near the limit, refueling would be necessary. \n\nBut the user hasn't mentioned a specific bill, so maybe the first step is to check the bill status. If the bill is overdue, sending a payment request might be needed. However, the user hasn't mentioned any overdue bills, so perhaps that's not the case here. \n\nSince the user is in France, enabling roaming is crucial. The enable_roaming function can be called to check if it's enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nSo the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Check if mobile data is enabled using check_network_status.\n2. Check APN settings with check_apn_settings.\n3. Check if roaming is enabled with enable_roaming.\n4. Adjust network mode preference to 4G/5G.\n5. If APN is incorrect, reset APN settings.\n6. If data is disabled, enable it.\n7. If data usage is near the limit, refuel data.\n\nBut since the user is asking for help, I need to call the appropriate tools step by step. The first thing is to check the current status. Let me start by calling check_network_status to see the current network status and APN settings. Then, based on the results, proceed with the necessary actions.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"check_network_status\", \"arguments\": {\"phone_number\": \"555-123-2002\"}}\n</tool_call>","tool_calls":null,"turn_idx":2,"timestamp":"2026-01-23T14:17:14.927789","cost":0.0,"usage":{"completion_tokens":708,"prompt_tokens":7214},"raw_data":{"id":"chatcmpl-1f9e588f89704f019b04e3d28d4d2","choices":[{"finish_reason":"tool_calls","index":0,"logprobs":null,"message":{"content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to help John Smith with his mobile data issue.
