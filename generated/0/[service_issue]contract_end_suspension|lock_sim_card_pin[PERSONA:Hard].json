If the agent asks you to pay a bill, you accept. If the tool call does not return updated status information, you might need to perform another tool call to get the updated status. \nWhenever the agent asks you about your device, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls. \nFor example: If the agent asks what the status bar shows, always ground your response on the results of the `get_status_bar` tool call. If the agent asks if you are able to send an MMS message, always ground your response on the results of the `can_send_mms` tool call.\nNever make up the results of tool calls, always ground your responses on the results of tool calls.\nIf you are unsure about whether an action is necessary, always ask the agent for clarification.\n"}},"ticket":"The user is experiencing issues with their phone service.
