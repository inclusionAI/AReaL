The user is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. He's having issues with mobile data—either it stops working or is very slow. He needs excellent internet speed and can't use Wi-Fi. I need to help him fix this.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a customer record for John. The tools include get_customer_by_phone, which can find the customer using their phone number. So I'll call that function with the phone number provided. If the customer is found, I can proceed.\n\nNext, once I have the customer's details, I need to check their mobile data status. The tools like check_network_status or run_speed_test might be useful. But since the user mentioned issues with mobile data, maybe the first step is to verify if the mobile data is enabled. If it's disabled, I can help turn it on.\n\nAlso, check if the line is suspended. If the line is suspended, the user might not have service. The suspend_line function could be used, but I need the customer and line IDs. Since I don't have those yet, maybe I should first get the customer info.\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided their customer ID or line ID. So I need to use the get_customer_by_phone function to find the customer. Once I have that, I can check the line status. If the line is suspended, I can try to resume it, but according to the policy, I can only lift suspension if the user has paid overdue bills. But the user hasn't mentioned that yet. So maybe first, check if the line is active.\n\nAlternatively, if the line is active, check the data usage. The get_data_usage function can retrieve current data usage. If the data is exceeded, refueling might be needed. The refuel_data function can add data, but the user needs to provide the GB amount.\n\nAlso, check if data roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. The enable_roaming function can be used here.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find John's customer using get_customer_by_phone.\n2. Check if the line is suspended. If so, check if the user has paid overdue bills. If not, maybe escalate to human agent.\n3. Check mobile data status. If disabled, enable it.\n4. Check data usage. If over limit, refuel.\n5.
