The user is having trouble sending MMS messages. They tried a few things already, like checking the network settings and rebooting. Now they're asking to restart their phone. I need to handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided their phone number, and I used the get_customer_by_phone function to retrieve their customer details. The customer is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. The account is active, and they have several lines and bills.\n\nNext, I checked the network status using the check_network_status function. The response showed that mobile data is disabled. That's a key point. Mobile data needs to be enabled for MMS to work. So, the user's mobile data switch is off. \n\nThe user then tried rebooting the phone, which is a common troubleshooting step. After rebooting, I need to check the network status again. If mobile data is still disabled, the next step is to enable it. \n\nSo, the next logical action is to use the toggle_data function to enable mobile data. Then, check the network status again to see if it's enabled. If it is, proceed to check APN settings. If the APN is incorrect, reset it and reboot again. \n\nAdditionally, check if the line is suspended. If suspended, the user might need to resume it. But since the user is at home and the line is active, maybe not. Also, check if data roaming is enabled, but since they're in the US, maybe not necessary. \n\nAnother possibility is that the APN settings are wrong. The check_apn_settings function should be called to verify the APN name and MMSC URL. If it's incorrect, reset the APN settings and reboot. \n\nAlso, check if the messaging app has the necessary permissions, like storage and SMS. If not, grant them. \n\nSo the steps would be: enable mobile data, check APN, reset APN if needed, check permissions, and then try sending MMS again. If all else fails, transfer to a human agent.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"toggle_data\", \"arguments\": {}}\n</tool_call>","tool_calls":null,"turn_idx":20,"timestamp":"2026-01-23T14:39:28.610381","cost":0.0,"usage":{"completion_tokens":454,"prompt_tokens":7586},"raw_data":{"id":"chatcmpl-a661f74cf6f14343a40224fef224c","choices":[{"finish_reason":"tool_calls","index":0,"logprobs":null,"message":{"content":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is having trouble sending MMS messages. They tried a few things already, like checking the network settings and rebooting. Now they're asking to restart their phone. I need to handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided their phone number, and I used the get_customer_by_phone function to retrieve their customer details. The customer is John Smith with the phone number 555-123-2002. The account is active, and they have several lines and bills.\n\nNext, I checked the network status using the check_network_status function. The response showed that mobile data is disabled. That's a key point. Mobile data needs to be enabled for MMS to work. So, the user's mobile data switch is off. \n\nThe user then tried rebooting the phone, which is a common troubleshooting step. After rebooting, I need to check the network status again. If mobile data is still disabled, the next step is to enable it. \n\nSo, the next logical action is to use the toggle_data function to enable mobile data. Then, check the network status again to see if it's enabled. If it is, proceed to check APN settings. If the APN is incorrect, reset it and reboot again. \n\nAdditionally, check if the line is suspended. If suspended, the user might need to resume it. But since the user is at home and the line is active, maybe not. Also, check if data roaming is enabled, but since they're in the US, maybe not necessary. \n\nAnother possibility is that the APN settings are wrong. The check_apn_settings function should be called to verify the APN name and MMSC URL. If it's incorrect, reset the APN settings and reboot. \n\nAlso, check if the messaging app has the necessary permissions, like storage and SMS. If not, grant them. \n\nSo the steps would be: enable mobile data, check APN, reset APN if needed, check permissions, and then try sending MMS again. If all else fails, transfer to a human agent.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"toggle_data\", \"arguments\": {}}\n</tool_call>","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1769150363,"model":"None","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":454,"prompt_tokens":7586,"total_tokens":8040,"completion_tokens_details":null,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}}],"task":{"id":"[mms_issue]airplane_mode_on|bad_network_preference|break_apn_mms_setting|data_usage_exceeded[PERSONA:Hard]","description":{"purpose":"Test resolution path: MMS (Picture/Group Messaging) Issues.","relevant_policies":null,"notes":null},"user_scenario":{"persona":"\nAt 64 years old, you're a retired librarian who keeps your phone use simple - mainly for calls, texts, and capturing photos of your grandchildren.
