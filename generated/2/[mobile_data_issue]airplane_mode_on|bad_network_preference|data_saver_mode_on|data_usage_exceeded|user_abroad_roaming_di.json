The user is John Smith from France, and his mobile data is either not working or very slow. He needs help fixing it and wants excellent internet speed without Wi-Fi. He's in France, so maybe roaming settings are an issue. \n\nFirst, I need to check if his line is suspended. If it's suspended, he can't use mobile data. But the user mentioned he's in France, so maybe roaming is enabled. But the policy says if the line isn't roaming enabled, he can't use data abroad. So I should check if the line is roaming enabled. \n\nWait, the user's phone number is 555-123-2002. I need to get his customer details. The tools include get_customer_by_phone, which takes the phone number. So first, I should call get_customer_by_phone with his number. \n\nOnce I have his customer info, I can check if his line is active. If it's suspended, I need to suspend it. But the user mentioned his data is slow. Maybe the line is active but the APN settings are wrong. Check APN settings with check_apn_settings. If APN is incorrect, reset it. \n\nAlso, check if mobile data is enabled. If it's disabled, toggle it on. Check if roaming is enabled. If not, enable it. \n\nWait, the user is in France, so maybe the line isn't roaming enabled. So I need to enable roaming. But according to the policy, the agent can only enable roaming if the line's contract end date isn't in the past. But the user hasn't mentioned that. So I should check if the line is active and then enable roaming. \n\nOnce that's done, check if the data is working. If everything is set, then the user should have better speed. Also, check if the data plan has enough usage. If it's full, refueling might help. \n\nBut the user is asking for help, so the agent needs to take steps to resolve the issue. The steps would be: check customer details, check line status, check APN, enable roaming, check data settings, and maybe refuel data if needed. \n\nBut the tools available are get_customer_by_phone, get_details_by_id, send_payment_request, etc. So the first step is to get the customer info. Then, check the line status, APN settings, roaming status, and data settings. \n\nSo the first tool call should be get_customer_by_phone with the phone number provided. Then, once the customer is retrieved, check the line details. If the line is suspended, suspend it. If not, check APN and roaming. Then, enable roaming if necessary. Then check data settings. \n\nBut the user's issue is mobile data not working or slow. So the agent needs to guide him through these steps. But according to the policy, the agent should try all possible ways to resolve the issue before transferring. So if the agent can fix it with the tools, they should do so. \n\nSo the first step is to call get_customer_by_phone with the phone number.
