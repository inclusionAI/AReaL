The user is John Smith from France, and his mobile data isn't working properly. He mentioned it's either stopping or very slow. He needs excellent internet speed.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a tool to help with mobile data issues. Looking at the provided tools, there's 'enable_roaming' and 'disable_roaming' functions. Since he's in France, maybe his line isn't roaming enabled. The 'enable_roaming' function could be used to enable data roaming, which would allow his phone to use data outside his home network.\n\nBut wait, the user's line status might need to be checked first. If the line is already suspended, we might need to suspend it first. However, the policy says we can only suspend if the line is active. So first, I should check if the line is active. If it's suspended, we can suspend it, but the user might need to pay overdue bills.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the roaming is disabled. So using 'enable_roaming' would help. But the user is in France, so the line's roaming status needs to be checked. If it's not enabled, enabling it would allow data roaming.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that mobile data is not working. So the steps could be: check if roaming is enabled, if not, enable it. Then check if there are other issues like APN settings, network mode preferences, etc.\n\nBut according to the policy, I should make one tool call at a time. So first, check if the line is active. If it's active, enable roaming. Otherwise, suspend it. But the user might not have the ability to suspend if the contract end date is approaching.\n\nWait, the user's line status might be active. So the next step is to enable roaming. So the function call would be 'enable_roaming' with customer_id and line_id. But I don't have the customer_id or line_id. The user provided phone number, so I need to get the customer and line info first.\n\nThe tools include 'get_customer_by_phone' to find the customer by phone number. So first, use that function with the phone number 555-123-2002. Once we have the customer, then get the line details. Then check if roaming is enabled.
