Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<Conclusion>By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait:

At t=1 - 1/√2,

First, we have √(2(t -1)^2 +1). Previously, we found that when calculating D1P + PQ_min(t) the total expression is √(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. When t is 1 -1/√2, substitute into that.

First term: compute 1 + 2(t -1)^2. t -1 = -1/√2. So squaring, (1/√2)^2 =1/2. Multiply by 2: 2*(1/2)=1. Then 1 +1=2. So sqrt(2). So the first term is sqrt(2). Second term is t =1 -1/√2. So total is sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2.

But sqrt(2) can be written as 2/√2. So total expression:

2/√2 +1 -1/√2= (2/√2 -1/√2) +1=1/√2 +1.

Therefore, 1 +1/√2. Which is also equal to 1 + sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Alternatively, combining terms:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:

Wait, sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)/1. So:

sqrt(2) -1/√2= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:  sqrt(2) is 2/sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2 =1 + (sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=1 +1/sqrt(2). So both are equivalent.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2. This is approx 1 +0.707≈1.707.

But let's rationalize 1/√2 as sqrt(2)/2. So 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Alternatively, (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

So, which form is preferred? Both are equivalent. The answer may prefer either form. Let me check with alternative calculation.

Alternatively, compute original f(t):

sqrt(2) + (1 -1/√2) =1 + sqrt(2) -1/√2. Let's rearrange terms.

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Yeah, wait: sqrt(2) can be written as 2/sqrt(2). Therefore, 2/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes, we have 1 +1/sqrt(2).

But in any case, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2, which equals (sqrt(2) +1)/sqrt(2) - Hmmm,Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Since 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So both expressions are correct. The form of the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 +1 or 1 + sqrt(2)/2. As a combined fraction, that would be (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

Hence, perhaps the answer is (2 + sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Either form is acceptable, but in Chinese math competitions, often rationalized denominators are required, so sqrt(2)/2 is preferred over 1/sqrt(2). So writing it as (2 + sqrt(2))/2 is okay. However, most likely, the answer should be written as 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Let's verify:

At t=1 -1/sqrt(2):

First term D1P = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(1 +2*(1/2))=sqrt(2).

Second term PQ_min(t) = t=1 -1/sqrt(2).

So total sum: sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2). As above, which is simplified:

sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). So 1 +1/sqrt(2)。

Therefore, the minimal value is1 +1/√2.

Yes, rationalizing the denominator:

1/√2 =sqrt(2)/2, so it's 1 +sqrt(2)/2.

As per the instructions for writing the answer, we need to writeboxed{}.

Thus, the minimum value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}

Given a cube $A B C D-A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}$ with edge length $1$, let $P$ be a moving point on the space diagonal $B C_{1}$ and $Q$ be a moving point on the base $A B C D$. Find the minimum value of $D_{1} P + P Q$.<|im_end|>

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<Conclusion>By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait:

At t=1 - 1/√2,

First, we have √(2(t -1)^2 +1). Previously, we found that when calculating D1P + PQ_min(t) the total expression is √(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. When t is 1 -1/√2, substitute into that.

First term: compute 1 + 2(t -1)^2. t -1 = -1/√2. So squaring, (1/√2)^2 =1/2. Multiply by 2: 2*(1/2)=1. Then 1 +1=2. So sqrt(2). So the first term is sqrt(2). Second term is t =1 -1/√2. So total is sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2.

But sqrt(2) can be written as 2/√2. So total expression:

2/√2 +1 -1/√2= (2/√2 -1/√2) +1=1/√2 +1.

Therefore, 1 +1/√2. Which is also equal to 1 + sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Alternatively, combining terms:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:

Wait, sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)/1. So:

sqrt(2) -1/√2= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:  sqrt(2) is 2/sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2 =1 + (sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=1 +1/sqrt(2). So both are equivalent.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2. This is approx 1 +0.707≈1.707.

But let's rationalize 1/√2 as sqrt(2)/2. So 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Alternatively, (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

So, which form is preferred? Both are equivalent. The answer may prefer either form. Let me check with alternative calculation.

Alternatively, compute original f(t):

sqrt(2) + (1 -1/√2) =1 + sqrt(2) -1/√2. Let's rearrange terms.

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Yeah, wait: sqrt(2) can be written as 2/sqrt(2). Therefore, 2/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes, we have 1 +1/sqrt(2).

But in any case, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2, which equals (sqrt(2) +1)/sqrt(2) - Hmmm,Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Since 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So both expressions are correct. The form of the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 +1 or 1 + sqrt(2)/2. As a combined fraction, that would be (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

Hence, perhaps the answer is (2 + sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Either form is acceptable, but in Chinese math competitions, often rationalized denominators are required, so sqrt(2)/2 is preferred over 1/sqrt(2). So writing it as (2 + sqrt(2))/2 is okay. However, most likely, the answer should be written as 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Let's verify:

At t=1 -1/sqrt(2):

First term D1P = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(1 +2*(1/2))=sqrt(2).

Second term PQ_min(t) = t=1 -1/sqrt(2).

So total sum: sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2). As above, which is simplified:

sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). So 1 +1/sqrt(2)。

Therefore, the minimal value is1 +1/√2.

Yes, rationalizing the denominator:

1/√2 =sqrt(2)/2, so it's 1 +sqrt(2)/2.

As per the instructions for writing the answer, we need to writeboxed{}.

Thus, the minimum value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}

. Wait, but is 1 + sqrt(2)/2 correct?

Alternatively, converting back:

Wait, sqrt(2)= approximately1.414.

sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707.

So total≈1 +0.707≈1.707. But the edge length is 1, so the maximum distance between two points in the cube is sqrt(3) ≈1.732, which is the space diagonal. So 1.707 is somewhat less, which makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this problem as a reflection problem.

If we reflect point D1 over the space diagonal BC1 or something like that. Alternatively, use the reflection principle to convert the path D1P + PQ into a straight line.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

<Path>
2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<Conclusion>By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait:

At t=1 - 1/√2,

First, we have √(2(t -1)^2 +1). Previously, we found that when calculating D1P + PQ_min(t) the total expression is √(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. When t is 1 -1/√2, substitute into that.

First term: compute 1 + 2(t -1)^2. t -1 = -1/√2. So squaring, (1/√2)^2 =1/2. Multiply by 2: 2*(1/2)=1. Then 1 +1=2. So sqrt(2). So the first term is sqrt(2). Second term is t =1 -1/√2. So total is sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2.

But sqrt(2) can be written as 2/√2. So total expression:

2/√2 +1 -1/√2= (2/√2 -1/√2) +1=1/√2 +1.

Therefore, 1 +1/√2. Which is also equal to 1 + sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Alternatively, combining terms:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:

Wait, sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)/1. So:

sqrt(2) -1/√2= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:  sqrt(2) is 2/sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2 =1 + (sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=1 +1/sqrt(2). So both are equivalent.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2. This is approx 1 +0.707≈1.707.

But let's rationalize 1/√2 as sqrt(2)/2. So 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Alternatively, (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

So, which form is preferred? Both are equivalent. The answer may prefer either form. Let me check with alternative calculation.

Alternatively, compute original f(t):

sqrt(2) + (1 -1/√2) =1 + sqrt(2) -1/√2. Let's rearrange terms.

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Yeah, wait: sqrt(2) can be written as 2/sqrt(2). Therefore, 2/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes, we have 1 +1/sqrt(2).

But in any case, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2, which equals (sqrt(2) +1)/sqrt(2) - Hmmm,Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Since 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So both expressions are correct. The form of the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 +1 or 1 + sqrt(2)/2. As a combined fraction, that would be (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

Hence, perhaps the answer is (2 + sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Either form is acceptable, but in Chinese math competitions, often rationalized denominators are required, so sqrt(2)/2 is preferred over 1/sqrt(2). So writing it as (2 + sqrt(2))/2 is okay. However, most likely, the answer should be written as 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Let's verify:

At t=1 -1/sqrt(2):

First term D1P = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(1 +2*(1/2))=sqrt(2).

Second term PQ_min(t) = t=1 -1/sqrt(2).

So total sum: sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2). As above, which is simplified:

sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). So 1 +1/sqrt(2)。

Therefore, the minimal value is1 +1/√2.

Yes, rationalizing the denominator:

1/√2 =sqrt(2)/2, so it's 1 +sqrt(2)/2.

As per the instructions for writing the answer, we need to writeboxed{}.

Thus, the minimum value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}

. Alternatively (perhaps I made an error here... steps not fully done before. Wait no, perhaps I have to check if the minimal value is indeed achieved here.

So the path D1 to P to Q, but Q must be on ABCD. Since PQ_min(t) for each P(t) on BC1 is t.

Therefore, substituting that, f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. Then found the minimal t. At min t, sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(2). So sum becomes sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2)=1 +sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2).

But since sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2= sqrt(2)/2. So total=1 +sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Thus, I believe the minimal value is1 +sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 1.707.

Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

Another way: using geometric reflection.

When these kinds of problems (shortest path) with reflections, the minimal path D1P + PQ is a straight line in reflected space.

To minimize D1P + PQ where Q is on the plane ABCD. Maybe reflect D1 over the plane ABCD? Wait, but Q is variable. Alternatively, perhaps consider reflecting the cube or the points to turn the path into a straight line.

Alternatively, since Q is on ABCD, to minimize D1P + PQ, we can fix P and move Q to the closest point on ABCD, then link the total.

Which is what we did earlier. Since for each P(t), moving Q to the closest point on ABCD (which is along the vertical line from P(t) to ABCD, which is to (1,t,0)), the PQ distance is minimized as t. So sum D1P + PQ is sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) +t, found minimum at t=1 -1/√2, sum sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2, simplifies to1 +sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, yeah, this is correct.

Therefore, the minimal value is1 + sqrt(2)/2, so write boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \( D_1 P + P Q \) is \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<Conclusion>By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait:

At t=1 - 1/√2,

First, we have √(2(t -1)^2 +1). Previously, we found that when calculating D1P + PQ_min(t) the total expression is √(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. When t is 1 -1/√2, substitute into that.

First term: compute 1 + 2(t -1)^2. t -1 = -1/√2. So squaring, (1/√2)^2 =1/2. Multiply by 2: 2*(1/2)=1. Then 1 +1=2. So sqrt(2). So the first term is sqrt(2). Second term is t =1 -1/√2. So total is sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2.

But sqrt(2) can be written as 2/√2. So total expression:

2/√2 +1 -1/√2= (2/√2 -1/√2) +1=1/√2 +1.

Therefore, 1 +1/√2. Which is also equal to 1 + sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Alternatively, combining terms:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:

Wait, sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)/1. So:

sqrt(2) -1/√2= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:  sqrt(2) is 2/sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2 =1 + (sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=1 +1/sqrt(2). So both are equivalent.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2. This is approx 1 +0.707≈1.707.

But let's rationalize 1/√2 as sqrt(2)/2. So 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Alternatively, (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

So, which form is preferred? Both are equivalent. The answer may prefer either form. Let me check with alternative calculation.

Alternatively, compute original f(t):

sqrt(2) + (1 -1/√2) =1 + sqrt(2) -1/√2. Let's rearrange terms.

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Yeah, wait: sqrt(2) can be written as 2/sqrt(2). Therefore, 2/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes, we have 1 +1/sqrt(2).

But in any case, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2, which equals (sqrt(2) +1)/sqrt(2) - Hmmm,Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Since 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So both expressions are correct. The form of the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 +1 or 1 + sqrt(2)/2. As a combined fraction, that would be (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

Hence, perhaps the answer is (2 + sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Either form is acceptable, but in Chinese math competitions, often rationalized denominators are required, so sqrt(2)/2 is preferred over 1/sqrt(2). So writing it as (2 + sqrt(2))/2 is okay. However, most likely, the answer should be written as 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Let's verify:

At t=1 -1/sqrt(2):

First term D1P = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(1 +2*(1/2))=sqrt(2).

Second term PQ_min(t) = t=1 -1/sqrt(2).

So total sum: sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2). As above, which is simplified:

sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). So 1 +1/sqrt(2)。

Therefore, the minimal value is1 +1/√2.

Yes, rationalizing the denominator:

1/√2 =sqrt(2)/2, so it's 1 +sqrt(2)/2.

As per the instructions for writing the answer, we need to writeboxed{}.

Thus, the minimum value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}

1. Wait, but is 1 + sqrt(2)/2 correct?

Alternatively, converting back:

Wait, sqrt(2)= approximately1.414.

sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707.

So total≈1 +0.707≈1.707. But the edge length is 1, so the maximum distance between two points in the cube is sqrt(3) ≈1.732, which is the space diagonal. So 1.707 is somewhat less, which makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this problem as a reflection problem.

If we reflect point D1 over the space diagonal BC1 or something like that. Alternatively, use the reflection principle to convert the path D1P + PQ into a straight line.
</Path>


<Path>
2. Alternatively (perhaps I made an error here... steps not fully done before. Wait no, perhaps I have to check if the minimal value is indeed achieved here.

So the path D1 to P to Q, but Q must be on ABCD. Since PQ_min(t) for each P(t) on BC1 is t.

Therefore, substituting that, f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. Then found the minimal t. At min t, sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(2). So sum becomes sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2)=1 +sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2).

But since sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2= sqrt(2)/2. So total=1 +sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Thus, I believe the minimal value is1 +sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 1.707.

Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

Another way: using geometric reflection.

When these kinds of problems (shortest path) with reflections, the minimal path D1P + PQ is a straight line in reflected space.

To minimize D1P + PQ where Q is on the plane ABCD. Maybe reflect D1 over the plane ABCD? Wait, but Q is variable. Alternatively, perhaps consider reflecting the cube or the points to turn the path into a straight line.

Alternatively, since Q is on ABCD, to minimize D1P + PQ, we can fix P and move Q to the closest point on ABCD, then link the total.

Which is what we did earlier. Since for each P(t), moving Q to the closest point on ABCD (which is along the vertical line from P(t) to ABCD, which is to (1,t,0)), the PQ distance is minimized as t. So sum D1P + PQ is sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) +t, found minimum at t=1 -1/√2, sum sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2, simplifies to1 +sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, yeah, this is correct.

Therefore, the minimal value is1 + sqrt(2)/2, so write boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \( D_1 P + P Q \) is \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

Explorations into using geometric reflection principles and direct parametric optimization consistently lead to the same minimal value. While reflection methods were considered, the direct approach of expressing the sum of distances as a function `f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t` and minimizing it was clearly executed. This function simplifies to `sqrt(2) + 1 - 1/sqrt(2)`, which further simplifies to `1 + sqrt(2)/2`. This result is also consistent with any gamma function minimization. Thus, the minimum value of the sum is confirmed to be `1 + sqrt(2)/2`. This is a derivation-based solution focused on minimizing the given distance sum through direct calculation and simplification.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a cube labeled ABCD-A1B1C1D1 with edge length 1. We need to find the minimum value of D1P + PQ where P is a moving point on the space diagonal BC1 and Q is a moving point on the base ABCD.

First, let me visualize the cube. In a cube with edge length 1, all the edges are of length 1. The cube has two bases: the bottom base is ABCD and the top base is A1B1C1D1, with each vertex on the top base connected directly above the corresponding vertex on the bottom base. The space diagonal BC1 connects vertex B on the bottom base to vertex C1 on the top base.

So, BC1 is a space diagonal. Let's recall that a space diagonal in a cube connects two vertices that are not on the same face. In this case, B is connected to C1, which is diagonally opposite on the top face. Wait, actually, in a cube, each space diagonal goes from a vertex to the one farthest from it, passing through the interior of the cube. So, for vertex B, its opposite vertex would be D1. Wait, but BC1 is not the space diagonal. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vertices: Let me assign coordinates to the cube to get a clearer picture. Let’s set up a coordinate system where point A is at (0,0,0). Then, since the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- Bottom base (z=0):
  - A: (0,0,0)
  - B: (1,0,0)
  - C: (1,1,0)
  - D: (0,1,0)

- Top base (z=1):
  - A1: (0,0,1)
  - B1: (1,0,1)
  - C1: (1,1,1)
  - D1: (0,1,1)

So, the space diagonal BC1 connects point B (1,0,0) to point C1 (1,1,1). Similarly, another space diagonal would be from D to B1, etc.

Now, point P is moving along the space diagonal BC1. So, we can parametrize point P along BC1. Let’s denote parameter t as the parameter varying from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at B, and when t=1, P is at C1.

Therefore, the coordinates of point P can be written as:

P(t) = B + t*(C1 - B) = (1,0,0) + t*(0,1,1) = (1, t, t)

Similarly, point Q is moving on the base ABCD, which is the bottom face at z=0. So, Q is any point on the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0).

Our goal is to minimize the sum D1P + PQ.

First, let's note the coordinates of D1. From the coordinate system above, D1 is at (0,1,1).

So, D1 is (0,1,1), P(t) is (1, t, t), and Q is any point on the base, say Q(x, y, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

We need to compute D1P + PQ, which is the sum of the distances from D1 to P, and from P to Q.

So, expressing these distances with coordinates:

Distance D1P: distance between D1 (0,1,1) and P(1, t, t).

Calculating this distance:

√[(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2] = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2]

Similarly, the distance PQ: between P(1, t, t) and Q(x, y, 0).

Calculating PQ:

√[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2] = √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

So, the total distance to minimize is:

√[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]

But Q is any point on the base ABCD, so x and y can vary between 0 and 1. However, for a fixed P(t), we might want to choose Q optimally to minimize PQ. Then, given Q is variable, for each P(t), the minimum PQ would be the distance from P(t) to the base ABCD. Wait, but Q is on the base ABCD, which is the plane z=0. So, the minimal distance from P(t) to the base ABCD is just the vertical distance from P(t) to z=0, since moving directly downward. Since P(t) has z-coordinate t, moving straight down to (1, t, 0), which is on the base. But wait, is (1, t, 0) on the base ABCD? The base ABCD has coordinates where x and y range from 0 to 1. However, when t ranges from 0 to 1, the x-coordinate is 1, so (1, t, 0) is on the edge BB1A1A? Wait, no. Wait, in the base ABCD, the base is the square from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0). So, the edge BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Therefore, when t, which is in [0,1], (1, t, 0) is on edge BC of the base. So yes, Q can be (1, t, 0), which is on the edge BC.

Hence, for each P(t) along BC1, the minimal PQ would be the vertical distance to the base, which is t, since moving from (1, t, t) straight down to (1, t, 0), the distance is t. Wait, but hang on: PQ would be √[(x - 1)^2 + (y - t)^2 + t^2]. To minimize this over x and y in [0,1], the minimal distance would indeed be achieved at (x,y)=(1, t), but only if those x and y are within [0,1]. However, x must be in [0,1], and y in [0,1]. So for PQ, over x and y, the minimal value is when x is as close to 1 as possible (i.e., x=1) and y as close to t as possible (i.e., y = t if possible, which it is if t is within [0,1]). Hence, yes, the minimal PQ distance for a given t is √[(1 - 1)^2 + (t - t)^2 + t^2] = √[0 + 0 + t^2] = t. So PQ_min(t) = t.

Therefore, for each point P(t) on BC1, the minimal distance from P to Q on ABCD is t. So the total expression we need to minimize is D1P + PQ_min(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Thus, now the problem reduces to minimizing the function f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t where t is in [0,1].

So, let's compute f(t) and find its minimum.

Let me define f(t) = √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the square root: 1 + 2(t - 1)^2.

Let’s expand (t - 1)^2: t^2 - 2t + 1. So multiplying by 2:

2t^2 - 4t + 2. Adding 1 gives 2t^2 - 4t + 3. Therefore, the square root becomes √(2t^2 - 4t + 3). So f(t) simplifies to √(2t^2 - 4t + 3) + t. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, keeping it as √[1 + 2(t - 1)^2] + t.

Let's think in parallel

1. Alternatively, we can set u = t - 1. Wait, but maybe calculus is easier here.

We can take the derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.

Compute f’(t):

f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t

f’(t) = [1/(2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2))] * (2*(2)(t - 1)) + 1

Wait, let's do this step by step. The derivative of sqrt(u) is (1/(2*sqrt(u))) * u’

Here, u = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2, so du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*(1) = 4(t - 1). Wait, hold on: derivative of (t -1)^2 is 2(t - 1)* derivative of (t -1), which is 1. So, du/dt = 2*1*(t - 1).

Wait, actually, no. Wait:

Wait, if u = 1 + 2*(t -1)^2, then du/dt = 2*2*(t - 1)*1 = 4(t -1). Because:

First, derivative of 2*(t -1)^2 is 2*2*(t -1)*(1) as per chain rule, so 4(t - 1). Right.

Therefore, f’(t) = [4(t -1)] / [2*sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] + 1 = [2(t -1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + 1

Therefore, f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1

Set this derivative equal to zero:

[2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] + 1 = 0

Let’s denote s = t -1. Then, since t ∈ [0,1], s ∈ [-1,0]

So, substituting s:

[2s / sqrt(1 + 2s2)] +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + 2s2):

2s + sqrt(1 + 2s2) = 0

Bring sqrt(1 + 2s2) to the other side:

sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Square both sides:

1 + 2s2 = 4s2

Subtract 2s2:

1 = 2s2

Thus, s2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2

But s was defined as t -1 ∈ [-1,0]. So s is between -1 and 0, so s = -1/√2 is the solution.

Check in the equation: sqrt(1 + 2s2) = -2s

Left-hand side (LHS): sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2)) = sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2) >0
Right-hand side (RHS): -2*(-1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Therefore, it's valid.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t -1 = -1/√2 => t =1 -1/√2 ≈1 -0.707≈0.293. Which is within [0,1], so valid.

Hence, the critical point is at t =1 -1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point gives a minimum.

Check the second derivative.

Alternatively, check the first derivative sign around t =1 -1/√2.

Let’s compute f’(t):

f’(t) = [2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)] +1

At t slightly less than 1 -1/√2, then t -1 is slightly less than -1/√2, so the numerator 2(t -1) is more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(2), so as t changes, the denominator will slightly increase or decrease. Let me compute at t =1 -1/√2:

Plug t=1 -1/√2 into the denominator:

sqrt(1 +2*( (-1/√2))2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2*(1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So the first term becomes 2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-2/√2)/√2= (-2/√2)*(1/√2)= -2/2= -1. Therefore, the derivative at this critical point is -1 +1=0.

Therefore, the first term is -1, which becomes +0.

Now, check the derivative when t is slightly less than1 -1/sqrt(2):

Say t is approaching from the left. Then, t -1 approaches -1/√2 from the left, so t -1 is slightly more negative (e.g., -1/√2 - ε). Then, the numerator 2(t-1) is slightly more negative. The denominator sqrt(1 +2(t-1)^2) is sqrt(1 + 2*( (-1/√2 -ε)^2 )) which is slightly larger than sqrt(2). Therefore, 2(t -1)/sqrt(...) is slightly more negative. Therefore, - that term +1 would mean the derivative is slightly less than 0? Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if we take t approaching the critical point from below (left), then the derivative f’(t) is going to have:

2(t -1)/sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) ≈2*(-1/√2)/sqrt(2) = -1 (exactly the critical point), so if t is a bit less, let's think:

Wait, when moving from t approaching infinity side? No, t is in [-1,0] which is s = t -1, but perhaps this calculus is getting too bogged down. Instead, maybe evaluating the derivative at two points.

Take t =0.

At t=0:

f’(0) = [2*(-1)/sqrt(1 + 2*(-1)^2)] +1= [ -2/sqrt(3) ] +1≈ -2/1.732 +1≈ -1.1547 +1≈ -0.1547 <0

Take t=1:

f’(1) = [2*(0)/sqrt(1 +0)] +1=0 +1=1>0

Therefore, the derivative goes from negative to positive as t increases through t=1 -1/√2 ≈0.2929. Therefore, this critical point is indeed a minimum.

<Path>
2. Alternatively, is there a critical point inside the interval [0,1]? Let’s compute f'(t):

f'(t) = derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + derivative of t. Let's compute:

First, derivative of √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2):

Let’s denote u(t) = 1 + 2(t - 1)^2. Then, derivative is (1/(2√u)) * u’(t). Compute u’(t):

u’(t) = 2 * 2(t - 1) = 4(t - 1). So, derivative becomes [4(t - 1)] / [2√(1 + 2(t - 1)^2)] ) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2). Then, adding the derivative of t, which is 1. Hence, overall:

f’(t) = [2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1.

We need to set this derivative to zero to find critical points.

So:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + 1 = 0.

Let me rearrange:

[2(t - 1)] / √(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) = -1.

Let’s let s = (t - 1). Then, the equation becomes:

2s / √(1 + 2s^2) = -1.

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(4s^2) / (1 + 2s^2) = 1.

Multiply both sides by (1 + 2s^2):

4s^2 = 1 + 2s^2.

Subtract 2s^2 from both sides:

2s^2 = 1 => s^2 = 1/2 => s = ±1/√2.

But recall that s = t - 1. Also, since t is in [0,1], s is in [-1,0]. So s = -1/√2 is in the interval [-1, 0), while s = 1/√2 is positive and not in the interval of s.

Check if s = -1/√2 is a solution.

Plug back s = -1/√2 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: [2*(-1/√2)] / √(1 + 2*(1/2)) = (-2/√2)/√(1 + 1) = (-2/√2)/√2) = (-2/√2)/√2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Which equals the right-hand side, so correct.

Therefore, s = -1/√2 => t - 1 = -1/√2 => t = 1 - 1/√2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293, which is within [0,1], so valid.

Therefore, the critical point is at t = 1 - 1/√2.

Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. Let’s check the sign of the derivative around t = 1 - 1/√2.

Let’s consider values less than t (say t1 = 1 - 1/√2 - ε) and greater than t (t2 = 1 - 1/√2 + ε), compute f’(t1) and f’(t2).

At t1, let's pick ε = 0.1. Then, t1 ≈ 0.293 - 0.1 = 0.193.

Compute [2(t1 - 1)] / sqrt(1 + 2(t1 - 1)^2) + 1:

First, t1 - 1 ≈ -0.807

Numerator: 2*(-0.807) ≈ -1.614

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.807)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.651) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1.302) ≈ sqrt(2.302) ≈ 1.517

So, the first term: -1.614 / 1.517 ≈ -1.065. Then, +1 gives -0.065 < 0.

At t2 ≈ 0.293 + 0.1 = 0.393.

Compute t2 - 1 = -0.607.

Numerator: 2*(-0.607) = -1.214

Denominator: sqrt(1 + 2*(0.607)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2*0.368) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.736) ≈ sqrt(1.736) ≈ 1.318

First term: -1.214 / 1.318 ≈ -0.921. Then, +1 gives 0.079 > 0.

Hence, the derivative changes from negative to positive at t = 1 - 1/√2, so this is indeed a local minimum. Since f(t) is convex (as the second derivative would be positive), this is the global minimum on [0,1].

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t = 1 - 1/√2. Now compute f(t) at this t.

So, let’s compute f(t) at t = 1 - 1/√2.

First, let's compute t - 1 = -1/√2.

Compute 1 + 2(t - 1)^2 = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2. So sqrt(2).

Therefore, the first term in f(t) is sqrt(2). Then, adding t:

f(t) = sqrt(2) + (1 - 1/√2) = 1 + sqrt(2) - 1/√2.

We can rationalize 1/√2 as √2/2. So:

1 + sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2 = 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Alternatively, write as 1 + (√2)/2, which is also equal to (2 + √2)/2.

<Conclusion>By taking the derivative of the function $f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t$, setting it to zero, and solving for $t$, we find a critical point at $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This value of $t$ is within the interval $[0,1]$. Numerical evaluation of the derivative around this critical point (e.g., at $t=0.193$ and $t=0.393$) shows that it changes sign from negative to positive, confirming that $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is indeed a local minimum. To find the minimum value, substitute $t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ into $f(t)$. This gives $\sqrt{1 + 2(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2} + (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Combining the terms, this simplifies to $1 + \sqrt{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Both approaches consistently lead to the same critical point and confirm it is a minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait:

At t=1 - 1/√2,

First, we have √(2(t -1)^2 +1). Previously, we found that when calculating D1P + PQ_min(t) the total expression is √(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. When t is 1 -1/√2, substitute into that.

First term: compute 1 + 2(t -1)^2. t -1 = -1/√2. So squaring, (1/√2)^2 =1/2. Multiply by 2: 2*(1/2)=1. Then 1 +1=2. So sqrt(2). So the first term is sqrt(2). Second term is t =1 -1/√2. So total is sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2.

But sqrt(2) can be written as 2/√2. So total expression:

2/√2 +1 -1/√2= (2/√2 -1/√2) +1=1/√2 +1.

Therefore, 1 +1/√2. Which is also equal to 1 + sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Alternatively, combining terms:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:

Wait, sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)/1. So:

sqrt(2) -1/√2= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no:  sqrt(2) is 2/sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes:

sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2 =1 + (sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=1 +1/sqrt(2). So both are equivalent.

Hence, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2. This is approx 1 +0.707≈1.707.

But let's rationalize 1/√2 as sqrt(2)/2. So 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Alternatively, (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

So, which form is preferred? Both are equivalent. The answer may prefer either form. Let me check with alternative calculation.

Alternatively, compute original f(t):

sqrt(2) + (1 -1/√2) =1 + sqrt(2) -1/√2. Let's rearrange terms.

But sqrt(2) -1/√2 = (2 -1)/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Yeah, wait: sqrt(2) can be written as 2/sqrt(2). Therefore, 2/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =1/sqrt(2). Therefore, yes, we have 1 +1/sqrt(2).

But in any case, the minimal value is 1 +1/√2, which equals (sqrt(2) +1)/sqrt(2) - Hmmm,Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Since 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

So both expressions are correct. The form of the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 +1 or 1 + sqrt(2)/2. As a combined fraction, that would be (2 + sqrt(2))/2.

Hence, perhaps the answer is (2 + sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 1 + sqrt(2)/2.

Either form is acceptable, but in Chinese math competitions, often rationalized denominators are required, so sqrt(2)/2 is preferred over 1/sqrt(2). So writing it as (2 + sqrt(2))/2 is okay. However, most likely, the answer should be written as 1 + sqrt(2)/2. Let's verify:

At t=1 -1/sqrt(2):

First term D1P = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(1 +2*(1/2))=sqrt(2).

Second term PQ_min(t) = t=1 -1/sqrt(2).

So total sum: sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2). As above, which is simplified:

sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = (2 -1)/sqrt(2)=1/sqrt(2). So 1 +1/sqrt(2)。

Therefore, the minimal value is1 +1/√2.

Yes, rationalizing the denominator:

1/√2 =sqrt(2)/2, so it's 1 +sqrt(2)/2.

As per the instructions for writing the answer, we need to writeboxed{}.

Thus, the minimum value is 1 + (sqrt(2)/2). Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}

1. Wait, but is 1 + sqrt(2)/2 correct?

Alternatively, converting back:

Wait, sqrt(2)= approximately1.414.

sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707.

So total≈1 +0.707≈1.707. But the edge length is 1, so the maximum distance between two points in the cube is sqrt(3) ≈1.732, which is the space diagonal. So 1.707 is somewhat less, which makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this problem as a reflection problem.

If we reflect point D1 over the space diagonal BC1 or something like that. Alternatively, use the reflection principle to convert the path D1P + PQ into a straight line.
</Path>


<Path>
2. Alternatively (perhaps I made an error here... steps not fully done before. Wait no, perhaps I have to check if the minimal value is indeed achieved here.

So the path D1 to P to Q, but Q must be on ABCD. Since PQ_min(t) for each P(t) on BC1 is t.

Therefore, substituting that, f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t -1)^2) + t. Then found the minimal t. At min t, sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2)=sqrt(2). So sum becomes sqrt(2) +1 -1/sqrt(2)=1 +sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2).

But since sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) =sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)/2= sqrt(2)/2. So total=1 +sqrt(2)/2 ≈1 +0.707≈1.707.

Thus, I believe the minimal value is1 +sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 1.707.

Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

Another way: using geometric reflection.

When these kinds of problems (shortest path) with reflections, the minimal path D1P + PQ is a straight line in reflected space.

To minimize D1P + PQ where Q is on the plane ABCD. Maybe reflect D1 over the plane ABCD? Wait, but Q is variable. Alternatively, perhaps consider reflecting the cube or the points to turn the path into a straight line.

Alternatively, since Q is on ABCD, to minimize D1P + PQ, we can fix P and move Q to the closest point on ABCD, then link the total.

Which is what we did earlier. Since for each P(t), moving Q to the closest point on ABCD (which is along the vertical line from P(t) to ABCD, which is to (1,t,0)), the PQ distance is minimized as t. So sum D1P + PQ is sqrt(1 +2(t -1)^2) +t, found minimum at t=1 -1/√2, sum sqrt(2) +1 -1/√2, simplifies to1 +sqrt(2)/2.

Hence, yeah, this is correct.

Therefore, the minimal value is1 + sqrt(2)/2, so write boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \( D_1 P + P Q \) is \boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}.

<Conclusion>Explorations into using geometric reflection principles and direct parametric optimization consistently lead to the same minimal value. While reflection methods were considered, the direct approach of expressing the sum of distances as a function `f(t) = sqrt(1 + 2(t - 1)^2) + t` and minimizing it was clearly executed. This function simplifies to `sqrt(2) + 1 - 1/sqrt(2)`, which further simplifies to `1 + sqrt(2)/2`. This result is also consistent with any gamma function minimization. Thus, the minimum value of the sum is confirmed to be `1 + sqrt(2)/2`. This is a derivation-based solution focused on minimizing the given distance sum through direct calculation and simplification.

Given a cube \(ABC D - A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1\) with edge length 1, we need to find the minimum value of \(D_1 P + PQ\) where \(P\) is a moving point on the space diagonal \(BC_1\) and \(Q\) is a moving point on the base \(ABCD\).

1. **Parametrizing the Points**:
   - The coordinates of point \(D_1\) are \((0, 1, 1)\).
   - The coordinates of point \(P(t)\) on the space diagonal \(BC_1\) can be parameterized as \((1, t, t)\) where \(t \in [0, 1]\).
   - The base \(ABCD\) lies in the \(z = 0\) plane.

2. **Distance Calculations**:
   - The distance \(D_1 P\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (t - 1)^2 + (t - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2}
     \]
   - The minimal distance \(PQ\) for a fixed \(P(t)\) is the vertical distance from \(P(t)\) to the base \(ABCD\), which is \(t\).

3. **Minimizing the Function**:
   - The function to minimize is \(f(t) = \sqrt{1 + 2(t - 1)^2} + t\).
   - Taking the derivative and setting it to zero, we find the critical point \(t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

4. **Evaluating the Function**:
   - Substituting \(t = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) into the function \(f(t)\):
     \[
     f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \sqrt{1 + 2\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} + \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
     \]
     Simplifying this expression, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{2} + 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

Thus, the minimum value of \(D_1 P + PQ\) is \(\boxed{1 + \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\).
