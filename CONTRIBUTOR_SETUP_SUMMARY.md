gh auth login

# Apply labels from configuration
gh label sync -f .github/labels.yml --repo inclusionAI/AReaL
```

### 4. Announce to Community

After merging, announce the new contributor infrastructure:

### 5. Create "Good First Issues"

Start labeling existing issues or create new ones:

- Error message improvements
- Example script enhancements

Example good first issues:

````markdown
**Title:** Add type hints to reward functions in areal/reward/
**Labels:** good first issue, easy, area/reward, beginner-friendly

**Description:**
Many reward functions in `areal/reward/` are missing type hints.
This task involves adding proper type annotations to function signatures.

**Example:**
Change:
```python
def math_reward(prompt, completion, answer):
````

To:

```python
def math_reward(prompt: str, completion: str, answer: str) -> float:
```

**Files to update:**

- areal/reward/math.py
- areal/reward/code.py

**Resources:**

- [Code Style Guide](docs/contributing/code-style.md#type-hints)
- [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

```
