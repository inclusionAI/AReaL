================================================================================

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\n<reasoning_process>

<Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are those where n ≡ 1 mod 5? Let's check n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So that's a winning position. Hmm. Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are when n is a multiple of 5. Let's see:

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4. Then Bob takes 4 and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win if n=5. Wait, but if n=5, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. If she takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1 and wins. So regardless, Bob wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So maybe the losing positions are multiples of 5. Let's check n=10.

n=10: Alice can take 1 (leaving 9) or 4 (leaving 6). Let's see:

If Alice takes 1, leaving 9. Then Bob can take 4, leaving 5. Then Alice is forced to take 1 or 4. If Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob wins.

If Alice takes 4, leaving 6. Then Bob can take 1, leaving 5. Then Alice is forced to take 1 or 4. If Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1 and wins. So again, Bob wins. So n=10 is a losing position for Alice.

Similarly, n=15: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4, leaving 10. Then Alice is in a losing position as above. Alternatively, Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1, leaving 10. So regardless, Bob can force a win. So n=15 is a losing position for Alice.

So perhaps the losing positions are multiples of 5. So if n is a multiple of 5, then the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. But in this case, since Alice goes first, if n is a multiple of 5, then Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win. Therefore, the number of n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 2024.

Wait, but let's check n=20. Alice can take 1, leaving 19. Bob takes 4, leaving 15. Then Alice is in a losing position. Alternatively, Alice takes 4, leaving 16. Bob takes 1, leaving 15. Then Alice is in a losing position. So yes, n=20 is a losing position for Alice.

So the pattern seems to be that if n is a multiple of 5, then the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, so Bob can win. Therefore, the number of such n ≤ 2024 is floor(2024/5). Let's compute 2024 divided by 5: 2024 ÷ 5 = 404.8, so floor(2024/5) = 404. But wait, 5×404 = 2020, which is less than 2024. Then 2024 - 2020 = 4, so the quotient is 404. So there are 404 multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024. But wait, starting from n=5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. So the number is 404. Therefore, the answer would be 404. But let's confirm.

Wait, but let's check n=0. Wait, n starts at 1. So the first multiple is 5. The last multiple less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. So the sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The number of terms is (2020 - 5)/5 + 1 = (2015)/5 +1 = 403 +1 = 404. So yes, 404 numbers. Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 404. So the answer is 404. But wait, let me check if there's any exception in between.

Wait, for example, n=5: Bob wins. n=10: Bob wins. n=15: Bob wins. n=20: Bob wins. So the pattern holds. Therefore, the answer is 404. But let me check 2024 divided by 5. 5*404=2020, so 2024-2020=4. So the quotient is 404. So yes, 404 numbers. Therefore, the answer is 404. So I think that's the solution.

<answer>
To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win in the game where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, with Alice going first and the player who removes the last token winning.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the losing positions:**
   - A losing position is one where the player whose turn it is cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.
   - By analyzing the game, we observe that if \( n \) is a multiple of 5, the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. This is because:
     - If \( n \) is a multiple of 5, the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving the opponent with a position that is not a multiple of 5.
     - The opponent can then always adjust their move to return the game to a multiple of 5, eventually forcing the first player to take the last token.

2. **Count the multiples of 5 up to 2024:**
   - The sequence of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
   - The general form of the \( k \)-th multiple of 5 is \( 5k \).
   - To find the largest \( k \) such that \( 5k \leq 2024 \):
     \[
     k \leq \frac{2024}{5} = 404.8
     \]
     - Taking the floor value, we get \( k = 404 \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 404 multiples of 5 between 1 and 2024.
   - Therefore, there are 404 values of \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win.

### Final Answer:
The number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{404}\).
