<Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or a relationship between the functions that can be exploited. Let's consider the equations again.

We have:

1. y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

2. x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

Let me try substituting one into the other. For instance, substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1. But equation 1 is already solved for y in terms of x. Alternatively, substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2.

But equation 2 is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). If I substitute y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) into this, we get:

x = 4g(f(cos(3π * 4g(f(sin(2πx)))))

But this seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the ranges of the functions involved. Let's analyze the possible values that f and g can take.

First, f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. The innermost function |x| is always non-negative. Then, | |x| - 1/2 | can take values from 0 to infinity, but since we are dealing with real numbers, perhaps we can find the range of f(x).

Wait, actually, for any real x, |x| can be any non-negative real number. Then | |x| - 1/2 | can be:

- If |x| ≥ 1/2, then | |x| - 1/2 | = |x| - 1/2, which can be from 0 to infinity.

- If |x| < 1/2, then | |x| - 1/2 | = 1/2 - |x|, which is between 0 and 1/2.

Therefore, the range of f(x) is [0, ∞). Similarly, g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |, so the range of g(x) is also [0, ∞).

But since f(x) and g(x) are both non-negative, then 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is non-negative, as is 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Therefore, y and x in the equations must be non-negative. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify that x and y are non-negative. Hmm. Wait, but since the right-hand sides of both equations are non-negative (as they are 4 times something non-negative), then x and y must be non-negative. So we can restrict our search to x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.

That's an important point. So we can limit the domain to x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.

Now, let's consider the functions f and g. Let's try to find the possible values of f(sin(2πx)) and g(cos(3πy)).

First, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and its range is [-1, 1]. Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, and its range is [-1, 1].

But since x and y are non-negative, let's consider the ranges:

For f(sin(2πx)):

sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1], so |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0, 1], then | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | ∈ [0, 1/2]. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2]. Therefore, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0, 4g(1/2)].

Compute 4g(1/2): g(1/2) = | |1/2| - 1/4 | = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4. Therefore, 4g(1/2) = 4*(1/4) = 1. So the maximum value of y is 1. Therefore, y ∈ [0, 1].

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))):

cos(3πy) ∈ [-1, 1], so |cos(3πy)| ∈ [0, 1], then | |cos(3πy)| - 1/4 | ∈ [0, 3/4]. Therefore, f(cos(3πy)) ∈ [0, 3/4]. Then, 4g(f(cos(3πy))) ∈ [0, 4g(3/4)].

Compute 4g(3/4): g(3/4) = | |3/4| - 1/4 | = |3/4 - 1/4| = 1/2. Therefore, 4g(3/4) = 4*(1/2) = 2. So x ∈ [0, 2].

Therefore, the possible x-values are between 0 and 2, and y between 0 and 1.

So now, we can restrict our search to x ∈ [0, 2] and y ∈ [0, 1].

Next, let's analyze the functions f and g over these intervals.

First, consider f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 |. Let's break this into cases:

Case 1: t ≥ 1/2. Then |t| = t, so f(t) = t - 1/2.

Case 2: t < 1/2. Then |t| = -t (since t is negative?), wait no. Wait, t is a real number. If t is negative, |t| = -t. But in our case, since we have f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 |, regardless of t's sign, |t| is non-negative. So:

If |t| ≥ 1/2, then f(t) = |t| - 1/2.

If |t| < 1/2, then f(t) = 1/2 - |t|.

Therefore, f(t) is a V-shaped function with a minimum at |t| = 1/2.

Similarly, g(t) = | |t| - 1/4 |. So similar behavior: if |t| ≥ 1/4, then g(t) = |t| - 1/4; if |t| < 1/4, then g(t) = 1/4 - |t|.

Therefore, both f and g are functions that decrease from infinity to 1/2 (for f) or 1/4 (for g) and then increase again.

But since we are dealing with f(t) and g(t) composed with sine and cosine, which are bounded, perhaps we can find the number of solutions by analyzing the equations in terms of the number of times the functions cross each other.

Alternatively, since the equations are symmetric in a way, maybe there are multiple solutions. Let's try to find the number of solutions step by step.

First, let's consider the equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Since y must be between 0 and 1, and x between 0 and 2, let's see how y varies with x.

The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, so over x ∈ [0, 2], it completes two full cycles. Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, so over y ∈ [0, 1], it completes 3/2 cycles. But since we are dealing with functions inside other functions, the composition might complicate things.

Alternatively, let's try to find the number of solutions by considering the number of times the functions f and g can intersect when composed.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for solutions where the arguments of f and g are symmetric or have certain relationships.

Alternatively, let's consider possible values of x and y where these equations hold.

First, let's note that both equations involve 4 times a function of the other variable. So, for example, in the first equation, y is expressed in terms of x, and in the second equation, x is expressed in terms of y. So perhaps substituting one into the other can help.

Let me try substituting y from equation 1 into equation 2.

But equation 2 is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). If we substitute y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) into this, we get:

x = 4g(f(cos(3π * 4g(f(sin(2πx)))))

But this seems very complex. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's consider possible fixed points where x and y satisfy both equations. Let's suppose that x and y are such that both equations hold. Let's try to find possible x and y.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for solutions where the functions f and g are in some way inverses or satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, let's consider the possible ranges and see how many times the functions can intersect.

First, let's consider the equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Since y must be between 0 and 1, and x between 0 and 2, let's see how the right-hand side behaves.

The function f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/2, so 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is between 0 and 4g(1/2) = 1. So y is between 0 and 1, which matches our earlier conclusion.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), x is between 0 and 2.

Let me try to find the number of solutions by considering the number of times the functions f and g can intersect when composed.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for solutions where the arguments of f and g are symmetric or have certain relationships.

Alternatively, let's consider possible values of x and y where these equations hold.

First, let's note that both equations involve 4 times a function of the other variable. So perhaps there is a symmetry here. Let's see.

Suppose that we have a solution (x, y). Then, substituting into both equations, we have:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

Now, if we can find another solution (x', y') such that x' = y and y' = x, then we can have a symmetric solution. Let's check if that's possible.

Suppose x' = y and y' = x. Then, substituting into the equations:

y' = 4g(f(sin(2πx')))

But y' = x, and x' = y, so:

x = 4g(f(sin(2πy)))

Similarly, the second equation would become:

x' = 4g(f(cos(3πy')))

But x' = y, and y' = x, so:

y = 4g(f(cos(3πx)))

But this is exactly the original system. Therefore, if (x, y) is a solution, then (y, x) is also a solution. Therefore, solutions come in pairs where x and y are swapped. However, this depends on whether the functions allow such symmetry.

But we need to check if such solutions exist. For example, if x = y, then we would have:

x = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4g(f(cos(3πx)))

So, if x = y, then both equations must hold. Let's check if such x exists.

Set x = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πx))). Therefore, we need:

4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πx)))

Which implies g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πx)))

Since g is a function that is decreasing from infinity to 1/4 and then increasing, but since f(t) is between 0 and 1/2, then f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πx)) are between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, g(f(t)) is decreasing in this interval. Because for t in [0, 1/2], f(t) is decreasing from 1/2 to 0, so g(f(t)) would be increasing? Wait, let's check.

Wait, f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 |. For t in [0, 1/2], f(t) = 1/2 - t. So as t increases from 0 to 1/2, f(t) decreases from 1/2 to 0. Then, g(f(t)) = | f(t) - 1/4 |. So when f(t) is decreasing from 1/2 to 0, g(f(t)) is decreasing from |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4 to |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. Wait, so g(f(t)) is constant at 1/4? Wait, no. Wait, if f(t) is decreasing from 1/2 to 0, then g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4|. So when f(t) is greater than 1/4, which is when t < 1/4 (since f(t) = 1/2 - t > 1/4 => t < 1/4), then g(f(t)) = f(t) - 1/4. So when t < 1/4, g(f(t)) = (1/2 - t) - 1/4 = 1/4 - t. Which is decreasing as t increases. When t > 1/4, f(t) = t - 1/2, so g(f(t)) = |t - 1/2 - 1/4| = |t - 3/4|. So for t > 3/4, this is t - 3/4, which is increasing. For t between 1/4 and 3/4, it's 3/4 - t, which is decreasing.

Therefore, g(f(t)) first decreases from t=0 to t=3/4, reaching a minimum at t=3/4, then increases. Therefore, the function g(f(t)) is not injective over [0, 1/2], so there could be multiple t's with the same g(f(t)) value.

Therefore, the equation g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πx))) could have multiple solutions where sin(2πx) and cos(3πx) are symmetric around 3/4 or something.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to solve the equations analytically, we can consider the number of intersections based on the periodicity and the ranges.

Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πx) have different periods, the combination of the two functions in the equations will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 2/3, which is 2. Therefore, over x ∈ [0, 2], the functions repeat their behavior. Therefore, the number of solutions in [0, 2] can be determined by analyzing the behavior over one period and then multiplying by the number of periods. But since the LCM is 2, we can analyze over [0, 2].

But even within [0, 2], the functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πx) are oscillating. Let's consider how many times they can intersect or cross each other.

Alternatively, since the equations are symmetric, perhaps each intersection in x corresponds to an intersection in y, leading to multiple solutions.

Alternatively, let's consider specific points where the equations might hold.

For example, let's check x = 0.5. Then, sin(2π*0.5) = sin(π) = 0. Then, f(0) = | |0| - 1/2 | = 1/2. Then, g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4. Therefore, y = 4*(1/4) = 1. So y = 1.

Now, check if x = 4g(f(cos(3π*1))) = 4g(f(cos(3π))). cos(3π) = -1. So f(-1) = | | -1 | - 1/2 | = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Then, g(1/2) = 1/4, so x = 4*(1/4) = 1. Therefore, x = 1. But we started with x = 0.5, so this doesn't satisfy the equation. Therefore, (0.5, 1) is not a solution.

Wait, but if we start with x = 1, then y = 4g(f(sin(2π*1))) = 4g(f(0)) = 4g(1/2) = 1. Then, check x = 4g(f(cos(3π*1))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g(1/2) = 1. So (1, 1) is a solution. So that's one solution.

Similarly, check x = 0. Let's see: y = 4g(f(sin(0))) = 4g(f(0)) = 4g(1/2) = 1. Then, x = 4g(f(cos(0))) = 4g(f(1)) = 4g(|1 - 1/2|) = 4g(1/2) = 1. So (0, 1) is a solution. Wait, but x=0 is allowed? Since x ≥ 0. Yes. So that's another solution.

Wait, but when x=0, sin(0)=0, so f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, so y=1. Then, cos(3π*1)=cos(3π)=-1, f(-1)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, so x=1. But x=0 ≠ 1, so that's not a solution. Wait, hold on. Wait, if x=0, then y=1. Then, to check if x=0 is a solution, we need to see if x=4g(f(cos(3πy))). So y=1, so 3πy=3π, cos(3π)=-1, f(-1)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, so 4g(f(cos(3πy)))=1. But x=0 ≠1, so that's not a solution. Therefore, (0,1) is not a solution. Wait, so my mistake earlier. Let's recheck.

If x=0, then y = 4g(f(sin(0))) = 4g(f(0)) = 4g(1/2)=1. Then, to check if x=0 is a solution, we need to see if 0 = 4g(f(cos(3π*1))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g(1/2)=1. But 0 ≠1, so (0,1) is not a solution. Therefore, x=0 is not a solution.

Similarly, check x=1. Then y=1, and check if x=1=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. So that works. Therefore, (1,1) is a solution.

Similarly, check x=0.5. Then y=1 as before, but x=0.5 ≠1, so not a solution.

Check x=2. Then, sin(2π*2)=sin(4π)=0. So y=4g(f(0))=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. So x=2 ≠1, so not a solution.

So we have at least one solution at (1,1). Let's check if there are others.

Check x=1/3. Then, 3πx=π, cos(π)=-1. So f(cos(3πx))=f(-1)=1/2. Then, g(1/2)=1/4, so x=4*(1/4)=1. But x=1/3 ≠1, so no.

Check x=2/3. Then, 3πx=2π, cos(2π)=1. So f(1)=|1 -1/2|=1/2. Then, g(1/2)=1/4, so x=1. But x=2/3 ≠1.

Check x=1/6. Then, 3πx=π/2, cos(π/2)=0. So f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, x=1. But x=1/6 ≠1.

Check x=1/4. Then, 3πx=3π/4, cos(3π/4)=-√2/2 ≈-0.707. Then, | -0.707 | =0.707, so f(t)=|0.707 -0.5|=0.207. Then, g(0.207)=|0.207 -0.25|=0.043. Then, x=4*0.043≈0.172. But x=1/4=0.25. Not equal.

Similarly, check x=0.25. Then, y=4g(f(sin(0.5π)))=4g(f(1))=4g(0.5)=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. So x=0.25 ≠1.

Alternatively, maybe there are solutions where x and y are not integers. Let's consider the equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let’s assume that x and y are solutions where x ≠ y. Let's suppose that x and y are such that f(sin(2πx)) = a and f(cos(3πy)) = b, then we have y = 4g(a) and x = 4g(b). Also, since a = f(sin(2πx)) and b = f(cos(3πy)), we can write:

a = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |

b = | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |

But x = 4g(b) and y = 4g(a). So substituting back, we get:

a = | |sin(2π*(4g(b)))| - 1/2 |

b = | |cos(3π*(4g(a)))| - 1/2 |

This seems very complex, but perhaps we can find a relationship between a and b.

Alternatively, since we have y = 4g(a) and x = 4g(b), and the original equations relate x and y through a and b, maybe there's a symmetry here. If we can find a and b such that a and b satisfy the above equations, then x and y can be found.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let’s consider the possible values of a and b. Since a = f(sin(2πx)) and b = f(cos(3πy)), and since f(t) is between 0 and 1/2, then a and b are between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, 4g(a) and 4g(b) are between 0 and 2.

But x and y are between 0 and 2, as established before.

Let’s consider possible pairs (a, b) such that:

y = 4g(a)

x = 4g(b)

and

a = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |

b = | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |

This system might have multiple solutions. Let's try to find them.

First, let's consider the case where a = b. Then:

y = 4g(a)

x = 4g(a)

and

a = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |

But x = 4g(a), so:

a = | |sin(8πg(a))| - 1/2 |

This is a recursive equation in a. Let's try to solve it.

But this seems difficult. Alternatively, let's try specific values.

Suppose a = 1/4. Then, y = 4g(1/4) = 4*(1/4) = 1. Similarly, x = 4g(1/4) = 1. Then, check if a = | |sin(2π*1)| - 1/2 | = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. But a=1/4 ≠1/2. Therefore, this doesn't work.

Suppose a = 1/2. Then, y = 4g(1/2) = 1. x = 4g(1/2) =1. Then, check a = | |sin(2π*1)| -1/2 | = 1/2. So a=1/2. This works. Therefore, a=1/2 is a solution, leading to x=1, y=1.

Similarly, check a=0. Then, y=0, x=0. Then, a = | |sin(0)| -1/2 | = 1/2. But a=0 ≠1/2. So no.

Check a=1/4. Then, as before, it doesn't work.

Check a=3/4. Then, y=4g(3/4)=4*(1/4)=1. x=4g(3/4)=1. Then, check a= | |sin(2π*1)| -1/2 | =1/2. But a=3/4 ≠1/2. So no.

So the only solution in this case is a=1/2, leading to x=1, y=1.

But perhaps there are other solutions where a ≠ b.

Let’s consider a = 0. Then, y=0, x=4g(b). But a=0 = | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 |. So | |sin(2πx)| -1/2 | =0 => |sin(2πx)| =1/2 => sin(2πx)=±1/2.

So 2πx = π/6 + 2πk or 2πx = 5π/6 + 2πk.

Therefore, x=1/12 +k or x=5/12 +k.

But x must be in [0,2]. So possible x=1/12, 5/12, 13/12, 17/12.

But y=0, so x=4g(f(cos(3π*0)))=4g(f(1))=4g(0)=0. Therefore, x=0. But x=1/12 ≠0. Therefore, no solution here.

Similarly, for a=0, it's not a solution.

Now, consider a=1/4. Then, y=1, x=4g(b). Let's see if there's a solution where a=1/4 and b= something.

But this seems tedious. Maybe another approach.

Let’s consider the functions f and g. Since f and g are both V-shaped functions with minima at 1/2 and 1/4, respectively, the compositions f(g(t)) and g(f(t)) will have certain properties.

But maybe we can use the fact that the number of solutions to the equation f(g(t)) = t is related to the number of intersections of the functions f(g(t)) and t.

But this is still abstract. Alternatively, let's consider the equation y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Since y must be between 0 and 1, and x between 0 and 2, perhaps we can plot or analyze the behavior of the function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) over x ∈ [0, 2].

But since we can't plot, let's consider key points.

At x=0: sin(0)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, so y=1.

At x=1/4: sin(π/2)=1, f(1)=0, g(0)=1/4, so y=4*(1/4)=1.

At x=1/2: sin(π)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

At x=3/4: sin(3π/2)=-1, f(-1)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

At x=1: sin(2π)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

At x=5/4: sin(5π/2)=1, f(1)=0, g(0)=1/4, y=1.

At x=3/2: sin(3π)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

At x=7/4: sin(7π/2)=-1, f(-1)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

At x=2: sin(4π)=0, f(0)=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4, y=1.

So at all these points, y=1. But x=1 is the only solution where x=1 and y=1. All other points where y=1 have x=1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4, 2, but these x's do not satisfy x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) unless x=1.

Therefore, only (1,1) is a solution.

But wait, this seems to be the case. Because when y=1, x must be 1. And when x=1, y must be 1. Therefore, the only solution is (1,1).

But let's check if there are other solutions where y≠1.

Suppose y=0.5. Then, x=4g(f(cos(3π*0.5)))=4g(f(cos(3π/2)))=4g(f(0))=4g(1/2)=1. So x=1. Then, check if y=4g(f(sin(2π*1)))=4g(f(0))=1. But y=0.5 ≠1. Therefore, not a solution.

Similarly, if y=0.25, x=4g(f(cos(3π*0.25)))=4g(f(cos(3π/4)))=4g(|cos(3π/4)| -1/2)=4g(|-√2/2| -1/2)=4g(√2/2 -1/2). Compute √2/2 ≈0.707, so √2/2 -1/2≈0.207. Then, f(t)=0.207, g(0.207)=|0.207 -1/4|=0.043. So x≈4*0.043≈0.172. But y=0.25 ≠0.172.

Alternatively, check if there's a solution where x=0.25 and y=1. But as before, this doesn't satisfy the equations.

Therefore, after checking various points, it seems that the only solution is (1,1). Therefore, the number of intersections is 1.

But wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me check another possible solution.

Suppose x=1.5. Then, sin(2π*1.5)=sin(3π)=0. So y=4g(f(0))=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=4g(f(-1))=4g(1/2)=1. But x=1.5 ≠1.

Alternatively, x=0.75. Then, 3πx=2.25π, cos(2.25π)=cos(2π - 0.75π)=cos(0.75π)= -√2/2≈-0.707. So f(-0.707)=|0.707 -0.5|=0.207. Then, g(0.207)=0.043. So x=4*0.043≈0.172. But x=0.75 ≠0.172.

Alternatively, check x=0.172. Then, y=4g(f(sin(0.344π)))≈4g(f(0.841))≈4g(0.841 -0.5)=4g(0.341)=4*(0.341 -0.25)=4*0.091≈0.364. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*0.364)))=4g(f(cos(1.097π)))=4g(f(-0.342))=4g(0.342)=4*(0.342 -0.25)=4*0.092≈0.368. But x=0.172 ≠0.368.

This seems to be a loop. Therefore, perhaps there's only one solution at (1,1).

But to be thorough, let's check if there are solutions where x and y are different.

Suppose x=1.5. Then, y=4g(f(sin(3π)))=4g(f(0))=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. So x=1.5 ≠1.

Similarly, x=1.5, y=1. But x=1.5 doesn't satisfy the second equation.

Similarly, check x=0.75, y=1. Then, x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. But x=0.75 ≠1.

Therefore, it seems that the only solution is (1,1). Therefore, the number of intersections is 1.

But wait, another approach: since the functions are periodic, perhaps there are multiple solutions. Let's consider the periods.

The function sin(2πx) has period 1, and cos(3πy) has period 2/3. Therefore, the combination of the two functions in the equations will have a period equal to the least common multiple of 1 and 2/3, which is 2. Therefore, over x ∈ [0, 2], the functions repeat their behavior. Therefore, if we find solutions in [0, 2], we can determine if there are multiple solutions.

But given the previous checks, even within [0, 2], the only solution is at x=1, y=1.

Therefore, the number of intersections is 1.

But wait, this seems to be the case. However, I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe there are two solutions: (1,1) and another solution where x and y are different.

But based on the previous checks, I can't find another solution. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But wait, the problem is in Chinese, but the answer is likely 1. But I need to check once more.

Wait, let's check x=1.333... (4/3). Then, 3πx=4π, cos(4π)=1. So f(1)=0, g(0)=1/4, x=1. But x=4/3≈1.333≠1.

Alternatively, check x=0.666... (2/3). Then, 3πx=2π, cos(2π)=1. So f(1)=0, y=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. But x=2/3≠1.

Therefore, no.

Alternatively, check x=0. Let's see: y=1, x=4g(f(cos(0)))=4g(f(1))=0. So (0,1) is a solution? Wait, if x=0, then y=1. Then, check x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=4g(f(-1))=4g(1/2)=1. But x=0≠1. Therefore, (0,1) is not a solution.

Similarly, check x=2. Then, y=1, x=4g(f(cos(3π*1)))=1. So x=2≠1.

Therefore, the only solution is (1,1). Therefore, the number of intersections is 1.

But I'm surprised the answer is 1, but based on the analysis, it seems correct. Therefore, the number of intersections is \boxed{1}.

<answer>
To solve the problem of finding the number of intersections of the graphs of \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2 \pi x)))\) and \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3 \pi y)))\), where \(f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|\) and \(g(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{4} |\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analyze the functions \(f\) and \(g\):**
   - \(f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|\)
   - \(g(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{4} |\)

2. **Range of \(f\) and \(g\):**
   - The range of \(f(x)\) is \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).
   - The range of \(g(x)\) is \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).

3. **Behavior of \(f\) and \(g\):**
   - \(f(x)\) decreases from \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(0\) as \(|x|\) increases from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), then increases back to \(\frac{1}{4}\) as \(|x|\) increases from \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(1\).
   - \(g(x)\) decreases from \(\frac{1}{4}\) to \(0\) as \(|x|\) increases from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\), then increases back to \(\frac{1}{4}\) as \(|x|\) increases from \(\frac{1}{4}\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Substitute and solve:**
   - For \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\):
     - \(f(\cos(3\pi y)) = ||\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2}|\)
     - \(g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = |||\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2}| - \frac{1}{4}|\)
     - This equation is complex, but we consider specific values of \(y\).

   - For \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\):
     - \(f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}|\)
     - \(g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}| - \frac{1}{4}|\)
     - This equation is complex, but we consider specific values of \(x\).

5. **Check specific values:**
   - For \(x = 1\):
     - \(f(\cos(3\pi \cdot 1)) = f(-1) = \frac{1}{2}\)
     - \(g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)
     - \(y = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1\)
     - Check \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi \cdot 1))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1\)
     - This gives the solution \((1, 1)\).

6. **Verify other potential solutions:**
   - Other values of \(x\) and \(y\) are checked, but they do not satisfy the equations due to the behavior of \(f\) and \(g\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The only solution found is \((1, 1)\).
   - No other solutions exist based on the analysis.

Thus, the number of intersections is \(\boxed{1}\).
