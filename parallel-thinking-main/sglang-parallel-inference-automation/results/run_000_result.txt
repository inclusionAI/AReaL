================================================================================

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.<reasoning_process>
<parallel_processing>
<launch_threads>
<Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states that when Aya walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, including t minutes. So the time spent walking at s+2 is 2.4 - t/60 hours. Then, the distance would be (s+2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9 km. Similarly, when walking at s km/h, the time spent walking is 4 - t/60 hours, so s*(4 - t/60) =9.

So the equations are correct. Then solving gives s=4.5 km/h and t=20 minutes. Then, when she walks at s+0.5=5 km/h, the time spent walking is 9/5=1.8 hours=108 minutes, plus t=20 minutes, total 128 minutes. So the answer is 128. That seems correct.

But maybe the problem is expecting the answer in minutes only for the walking time? Wait, no, the problem says "Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So total time is walking time + t. So if walking time is 1.8 hours, that's 108 minutes, plus 20 minutes is 128. So 128 minutes. So the answer is 128.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Suppose that the total time when she walks at s km/h is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So the walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. Then, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, including t minutes. So the walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours. Then, the distance is (s+2)*(2.4 - t/60) =9. Then, same as before.

So, the equations are correct, leading to s=4.5 and t=20. Then, when she walks at 5 km/h, the walking time is 9/5=1.8 hours=108 minutes, plus t=20 minutes, total 128 minutes. So the answer is 128.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the time is calculated. Let me check with s=4.5 km/h. Then, time spent walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. If t=20 minutes, then walking time is 4 - 20/60 = 4 - 1/3 ≈ 3.6667 hours. 3.6667 hours *4.5 km/h = 16.5 km. But the distance is 9 km. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, 4.5 km/h * 3.6667 hours = 16.5 km, but the total distance is 9 km. That's not possible. Wait, that suggests an error in the problem setup.

Wait, this is impossible. If she walks 4.5 km/h for 3.6667 hours, she would have walked 16.5 km, but the total distance is only 9 km. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, my previous conclusion must be wrong.

Wait, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's re-examine the equations.

First equation: s*(4 - t/60) =9.

Second equation: (s+2)*(2.4 - t/60)=9.

We solved these equations and got s=4.5 and t=20. But when substituting back, the first equation gives 4.5*(4 - 20/60)=4.5*(4 - 1/3)=4.5*(11/3)= (9/2)*(11/3)= (99)/6=16.5, which is not 9. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, my solution is wrong.

Wait, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous steps.

Wait, this is a critical error. Let me re-examine the equations.

First equation: s*(4 - t/60) =9.

Second equation: (s+2)*(2.4 - t/60)=9.

Let me write them again:

1) s*(4 - t/60) =9

2) (s+2)*(2.4 - t/60)=9

Let me denote t/60 as x. Then:

1) s*(4 - x) =9

2) (s+2)*(2.4 - x)=9

We can solve these equations.

From equation 1: s = 9/(4 - x)

From equation 2: (s +2)(2.4 -x) =9

Substitute s:

(9/(4 -x) + 2)(2.4 -x) =9

Multiply through:

[ (9 + 2*(4 -x)) / (4 -x) ] * (2.4 -x) =9

Simplify numerator:

9 +8 -2x =17 -2x

So:

(17 -2x)/(4 -x) * (2.4 -x) =9

Multiply both sides by (4 -x):

(17 -2x)(2.4 -x) =9*(4 -x)

Expand left side:

17*2.4 -17x -2x*2.4 +2x² = 40.8 -17x -4.8x +2x² =40.8 -21.8x +2x²

Right side: 36 -9x

Set equation:

40.8 -21.8x +2x² =36 -9x

Bring all terms to left:

40.8 -21.8x +2x² -36 +9x=0

Simplify:

4.8 -12.8x +2x²=0

Divide by 2:

2.4 -6.4x +x²=0

Which is:

x² -6.4x +2.4=0

Now, solve for x:

x = [6.4 ± sqrt(6.4² -4*1*2.4)] /2

Calculate discriminant:

6.4² =40.96

4*1*2.4=9.6

So sqrt(40.96 -9.6)=sqrt(31.36)=5.6

Thus,

x=(6.4 ±5.6)/2

So two solutions:

x=(6.4 +5.6)/2=12/2=6

x=(6.4 -5.6)/2=0.8/2=0.4

So x=6 or x=0.4. But x is t/60, so t=60x. So t=360 minutes or t=24 minutes.

But t is the time spent in the coffee shop. If t=360 minutes, that's 6 hours. Then, in the first scenario, she walks for 4 hours total, so walking time is 4 -6/60=4 -0.1=3.9 hours. Then, distance is s*3.9=9. So s=9/3.9≈2.3077 km/h. Then, in the second scenario, she walks at s+2≈4.3077 km/h for 2.4 -6/60=2.4 -0.1=2.3 hours. Then, distance is 4.3077*2.3≈9.917 km, which is not 9. So this is invalid.

The other solution is x=0.4, so t=24 minutes. Then, in the first scenario, walking time is 4 -24/60=4 -0.4=3.6 hours. Then, s=9/3.6=2.5 km/h. In the second scenario, she walks at 2.5+2=4.5 km/h for 2.4 -24/60=2.4 -0.4=2 hours. Then, distance is 4.5*2=9 km. That works. So s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes.

Therefore, the correct solution is s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes. Then, when she walks at s+0.5=3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes, plus t=24 minutes, total 204 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, so earlier mistake was that when solving the quadratic equation, I considered x=6, which leads to t=360 minutes, but that gives an invalid result. The correct solution is x=0.4, leading to t=24 minutes and s=2.5 km/h. Then, when she walks at 3 km/h, the time is 3 hours walking plus 24 minutes in the shop, total 204 minutes.

<answer>
To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( t \) (in minutes) and the speed \( s \) (in km/h). We will use the given information to set up and solve a system of equations.

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( s \) be Aya's walking speed in km/h.
- Let \( t \) be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

### Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information

1. **When Aya walks at \( s \) km/h:**
   - Total time = 4 hours, which includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.
   - Time spent walking = \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - Distance = \( s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9 \) km.
   \[
   s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **When Aya walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h:**
   - Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes, which is \( 2.4 \) hours, and includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.
   - Time spent walking = \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - Distance = \( (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9 \) km.
   \[
   (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

### Step 3: Solve the system of equations

1. **Express \( s \) from Equation 1:**
   \[
   s = \frac{9}{4 - \frac{t}{60}}
   \]

2. **Substitute \( s \) into Equation 2:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{9}{4 - \frac{t}{60}} + 2\right) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{9 + 2 \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right)}{4 - \frac{t}{60}}\right) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{9 + 8 - \frac{2t}{60}}{4 - \frac{t}{60}}\right) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{17 - \frac{t}{30}}{4 - \frac{t}{60}}\right) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
   \]

4. **Let \( x = \frac{t}{60} \):**
   \[
   \left(\frac{17 - 2x}{4 - x}\right) (2.4 - x) = 9
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   (17 - 2x)(2.4 - x) = 9(4 - x)
   \]
   \[
   40.8 - 17x - 4.8x + 2x^2 = 36 - 9x
   \]
   \[
   40.8 - 21.8x + 2x^2 = 36 - 9x
   \]
   \[
   2x^2 - 12.8x + 4.8 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x^2 - 6.4x + 2.4 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x = \frac{6.4 \pm \sqrt{6.4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2.4}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6.4 \pm \sqrt{40.96 - 9.6}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6.4 \pm \sqrt{31.36}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6.4 \pm 5.6}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 0.4
   \]

7. **Determine the valid solution:**
   - \( x = 6 \) leads to \( t = 360 \) minutes, which is invalid as it results in a negative walking time.
   - \( x = 0.4 \) leads to \( t = 24 \) minutes and \( s = 2.5 \) km/h, which is valid.

### Step 4: Calculate the total time when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h

1. **New speed:**
   \[
   s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \text{ km/h}
   \]

2. **Time spent walking:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total time including coffee shop:**
   \[
   180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
