Okay, let's try to figure out how many self-describing 3x3 tables exist. The problem says each cell should contain the total number of even numbers in its row and column, excluding itself. Hmm, self-descriptive grids can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize a 3x3 grid. Let's denote the cells as a matrix where each cell is (i,j) with i being the row number and j the column number, both from 1 to 3. Each cell (i,j) has a value, let's call it V(i,j), which is the count of even numbers in row i and column j, but not counting the number in cell (i,j) itself.

So, for each cell, we need to look at its row and column, count the even numbers there, subtract 1 if the cell itself is even because we're supposed to exclude it, and set that count as the value of the cell. But wait, the problem states "the total number of even numbers in its row and column other than itself." Wait, does that mean we count the evens in the row and column separately and then add them together? For example, if in row i there are x even numbers (excluding (i,j)), and in column j there are y even numbers (excluding (i,j)), then V(i,j) = x + y?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify: when they say "the total number of even numbers in its row and column other than itself," does that mean we look at all cells in the same row and same column as the cell, except the cell itself, and count how many of those are even? So, for cell (i,j), it's the number of even numbers in row i (excluding (i,j)) plus the number of even numbers in column j (excluding (i,j))?

Yes, that seems right. So for each cell, you take the row and column it's in, remove the cell itself, and count the evens in the remaining cells of the row and column, then sum those two counts. So V(i,j) = (number of evens in row i excluding (i,j)) + (number of evens in column j excluding (i,j)).

But here's the catch: the value in the cell V(i,j) must also be even or odd. However, since V(i,j) is determined by the number of even numbers in the row and column (excluding itself), the parity of V(i,j) is dependent on the parities of the counts in the row and column. But we also need to consider that the cell (i,j) itself is part of the grid, so its value affects the counts for other cells. Therefore, this is a system where each cell's value is dependent on other cells, which in turn depend on it, creating a system of equations or constraints.

To approach this, maybe it's better to model the grid with variables indicating whether each cell is even or odd. Since the actual value is determined by the count of evens, perhaps we can represent each cell as a binary variable: 0 if even, 1 if odd. Then, for each cell (i,j), the sum of the row i (excluding (i,j)) in binary variables plus the sum of column j (excluding (i,j)) in binary variables must equal V(i,j). However, V(i,j) is also a number that should be even or odd. Wait, but if we use binary variables, 0 for even and 1 for odd, then the number of even numbers in a row would be the number of 0s. Hmm, maybe that's a more manageable way.

Alternatively, perhaps considering each cell's parity. Let me think.

Wait, each cell's value is the count of evens in its row and column (excluding itself). Let's note that counts can be from 0 to 4 (since in a row excluding itself, there are 2 other cells, and in a column excluding itself, there are 2 other cells, so total 4 cells). So V(i,j) can be 0,1,2,3,4. However, the value in the cell is also a number, so it must be even or odd. But since V(i,j) is determined by the number of even numbers in the row and column (excluding itself), the value in the cell must be equal to that count, and simultaneously, the parity (evenness/oddness) of the value must match the count's parity. For example, if the count is 3, then the cell must contain an odd number (3), but if the count is 2, the cell must be even (2). However, the problem states that each cell contains the total number of even numbers... So the cell's value is exactly the number, not just the parity. Therefore, each cell's value is exactly equal to the count of evens in its row and column (excluding itself). Therefore, each cell must satisfy that its value is equal to the number of even numbers in row i (excluding itself) plus the number of even numbers in column j (excluding itself). Therefore, all entries in the table must satisfy this condition.

This seems complex because each cell's value depends on the other cells in its row and column, which in turn depend on others. So, we need to find a 3x3 grid where for each cell, the number written there is equal to the number of even numbers in its row and column, excluding itself.

Let me think of possible strategies. Since each cell's value is determined by the evens in the row and column, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. However, since the values are counts (integers from 0 to 4), and the entries themselves are numbers (also integers from 0 to 4), this might require some combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that each entry's parity must be consistent with the number of evens in its row and column. Let's think about parity. For each cell (i,j), the value V(i,j) is the count of evens in row i (excluding (i,j)) plus the count in column j (excluding (i,j)). Let’s denote E_row(i,j) as the number of even numbers in row i excluding (i,j), and E_col(i,j) as the number in column j excluding (i,j). Then V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). Now, since E_row(i,j) can be 0,1,2 (since a row has 3 cells, excluding one leaves 2), and similarly E_col(i,j) can be 0,1,2. So V(i,j) can range from 0+0=0 to 2+2=4. So possible values are 0,1,2,3,4.

However, each cell's value is a number. Therefore, each cell must satisfy that V(i,j) is equal to E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). So the entire grid must satisfy these equations for all cells. This seems like a system of equations where each equation is V(i,j) = number of evens in row i excluding (i,j) + number of evens in column j excluding (i,j). But since V(i,j) is part of the grid, which in turn affects the evens in the rows and columns, this is a system that must be consistent.

Perhaps it's helpful to model this as a system of equations where variables are whether each cell is even or odd. Let's consider binary variables: let’s define for each cell (i,j), x_{i,j} = 0 if the cell is even, 1 if odd. Then, for each cell (i,j):

V(i,j) = (number of evens in row i excluding (i,j)) + (number of evens in column j excluding (i,j)).

But V(i,j) is the actual number in the cell. However, we can also relate V(i,j) to x_{i,j}: since x_{i,j} is 0 if V(i,j) is even, and 1 if V(i,j) is odd. Wait, but V(i,j) is a number between 0 and 4, so its parity is determined by whether it's even or odd. Therefore, x_{i,j} is the parity of V(i,j). However, the problem states that the cell's value is exactly the count. Therefore, V(i,j) must be equal to that count. Therefore, the count must be an integer between 0 and 4, and V(i,j) is exactly that integer.

But here's the problem: how can V(i,j) be both the count and also influence the counts in other cells? Because whether V(i,j) is even or odd affects the counts for the other cells in its row and column.

Wait, but each V(i,j) is a number, which can be even or odd. So for the purposes of other cells, the parity of V(i,j) matters because other cells in the same row or column will count it as even if V(i,j) is even.

Therefore, this is a system where each cell's value is a number (0-4), which must equal the count of even numbers (i.e., cells with even values) in its row and column, excluding itself.

Therefore, the value in each cell is both determined by and determines the parities of other cells. This interdependency is quite tight. Perhaps we can model this with equations for each cell.

Let me try to denote:

For each cell (i,j):

V(i,j) = (number of even numbers in row i excluding (i,j)) + (number of even numbers in column j excluding (i,j))

But the number of even numbers in row i excluding (i,j) is equal to (number of even numbers in row i) - (1 if V(i,j) is even else 0). Wait, no: if we exclude cell (i,j), then it's the number of evens in the entire row i minus 1 if cell (i,j) is even.

Wait, let's clarify:

Suppose in row i, the total number of even numbers is E_row_i. Then, the number of even numbers in row i excluding cell (i,j) is E_row_i - (1 if V(i,j) is even else 0). Similarly, for column j, total evens is E_col_j, so the number of evens in column j excluding (i,j) is E_col_j - (1 if V(i,j) is even else 0).

But V(i,j) is equal to [E_row_i - (1 if even)] + [E_col_j - (1 if even)].

But E_row_i is the number of even numbers in row i, which is the count of cells in row i that are even. Similarly for E_col_j.

But this seems recursive because E_row_i depends on the evenness of all cells in row i, including (i,j). Similarly, E_col_j depends on cell (i,j). Therefore, each V(i,j) is dependent on the evenness of all other cells in its row and column, which in turn depend on their own V values.

This seems quite complex. Maybe we can approach this with a system of equations. Let's consider all cells and write equations for each.

But since the equations are non-linear (because the evenness of a cell is a step function of its value), this might be challenging. Instead of solving equations, perhaps we can model the problem with variables indicating the parity (even/odd) of each cell, since the actual count of evens in a row or column depends only on the parities, not the exact values. Wait, but the count of evens is the number of cells with even values. So if we know the parities, we can compute the counts. However, the values themselves (V(i,j)) must be equal to the sum of the evens in their row and column (excluding themselves). Therefore, the value is determined by the parities of other cells. But the value's parity must also correspond to whether it's even or odd, which affects the counts for other cells.

Wait, maybe if we focus on the parities first. Let me see: For each cell (i,j), V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). The parity of V(i,j) is therefore (E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j)) mod 2. But also, the parity of V(i,j) is x_{i,j} (where x_{i,j} is 0 if even, 1 if odd). Therefore:

x_{i,j} ≡ (E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j)) mod 2

But E_row(i,j) is the number of even numbers in row i excluding (i,j). Let’s denote E_row_i as the total number of evens in row i. Then, E_row(i,j) = E_row_i - (1 - x_{i,j}), because if the cell (i,j) is even (x_{i,j}=0), then we subtract 1; if it's odd (x_{i,j}=1), subtract 0. Wait, wait. Wait, if x_{i,j} is 0 (even), then the count of evens in row i excluding (i,j) is E_row_i - 1. If x_{i,j} is 1 (odd), then E_row(i,j) = E_row_i. Therefore:

E_row(i,j) = E_row_i - (1 - x_{i,j})

Similarly, E_col(i,j) = E_col_j - (1 - x_{i,j})

Therefore, the equation for x_{i,j} becomes:

x_{i,j} ≡ [E_row_i - (1 - x_{i,j}) + E_col_j - (1 - x_{i,j})] mod 2

Simplify that:

x_{i,j} ≡ [E_row_i + E_col_j - 2*(1 - x_{i,j})] mod 2

But 2*(1 - x_{i,j}) is congruent to 0 mod 2, so:

x_{i,j} ≡ (E_row_i + E_col_j) mod 2

Therefore:

x_{i,j} ≡ (E_row_i + E_col_j) mod 2

But E_row_i is the number of even numbers in row i, which is equal to the number of x_{i,k} = 0 for k=1,2,3. Similarly, E_col_j is the number of x_{k,j} = 0 for k=1,2,3. So E_row_i = 3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k}, and E_col_j = 3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}

But substituting these into the equation:

x_{i,j} ≡ [(3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k}) + (3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j})] mod 2

Simplify:

x_{i,j} ≡ [6 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

But 6 mod 2 is 0, so:

x_{i,j} ≡ [- sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

Which can be written as:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} + sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

Because -1 ≡ 1 mod 2, so -sum ≡ sum mod 2.

Therefore, for each cell (i,j):

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} + sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

Wait, but sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} includes x_{i,j} itself. Similarly, sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j} includes x_{i,j}. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} + sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

But sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} = x_{i,1} + x_{i,2} + x_{i,3}

sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j} = x_{1,j} + x_{2,j} + x_{3,j}

Therefore, the equation becomes:

x_{i,j} ≡ (x_{i,1} + x_{i,2} + x_{i,3} + x_{1,j} + x_{2,j} + x_{3,j}) mod 2

But note that x_{i,j} is included in both sums. Specifically, in the first sum, it's x_{i,j} as part of row i, and in the second sum, it's x_{i,j} as part of column j. Therefore, the total sum is (sum of row i) + (sum of column j) = (sum of row i excluding x_{i,j} + x_{i,j}) + (sum of column j excluding x_{i,j} + x_{i,j}) = sum_row_i + sum_col_j - x_{i,j}

But in the equation, we have:

x_{i,j} ≡ (sum_row_i + sum_col_j) mod 2

But sum_row_i includes x_{i,j} and sum_col_j includes x_{i,j}, so when we add them, we have sum_row_i + sum_col_j = (sum_row_i_excl + x_{i,j}) + (sum_col_j_excl + x_{i,j}) = sum_row_i_excl + sum_col_j_excl + 2x_{i,j}

But 2x_{i,j} is 0 mod 2, so:

x_{i,j} ≡ (sum_row_i_excl + sum_col_j_excl) mod 2

But sum_row_i_excl is sum of x_{i,k} for k ≠ j, and sum_col_j_excl is sum of x_{k,j} for k ≠ i. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k≠j} x_{i,k} + sum_{k≠i} x_{k,j}] mod 2

But this seems a bit circular. Let me check with an example.

Suppose we have a cell (1,1). Then the equation would be:

x_{1,1} ≡ [x_{1,2} + x_{1,3} + x_{2,1} + x_{3,1}] mod 2

Similarly, for cell (1,2):

x_{1,2} ≡ [x_{1,1} + x_{1,3} + x_{1,2} + x_{2,2} + x_{3,2} - x_{1,2}]?

Wait, no. Wait, according to the equation:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} + sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}] mod 2

But sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k} is the sum of the entire row, and sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j} is the sum of the entire column. So for (1,2):

x_{1,2} ≡ [x_{1,1} + x_{1,2} + x_{1,3} + x_{1,2} + x_{2,2} + x_{3,2}] mod 2

Wait, that can't be right because x_{1,2} is in both the row and column sum. Therefore, the equation is:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_row_i + sum_col_j] mod 2

But sum_row_i and sum_col_j each include x_{i,j}, so the total sum is sum_row_i + sum_col_j = (sum_row_i_excl + x_{i,j}) + (sum_col_j_excl + x_{i,j}) = sum_row_i_excl + sum_col_j_excl + 2x_{i,j} ≡ sum_row_i_excl + sum_col_j_excl mod 2

Therefore, x_{i,j} ≡ (sum_row_i_excl + sum_col_j_excl) mod 2

Which is the same as:

x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k≠j} x_{i,k} + sum_{k≠i} x_{k,j}] mod 2

Therefore, each x_{i,j} is equal to the sum (mod 2) of the other elements in its row and column.

This is a system of 9 equations (one for each cell) with 9 variables (each x_{i,j} is 0 or 1). However, these equations are likely not all independent.

Let me try to write down these equations for all cells. Let's index the cells as follows:

x11 x12 x13

x21 x22 x23

x31 x32 x33

Now, the equation for x11:

x11 ≡ x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 mod 2

Similarly, for x12:

x12 ≡ x11 + x13 + x22 + x32 mod 2

For x13:

x13 ≡ x11 + x12 + x23 + x33 mod 2

For x21:

x21 ≡ x11 + x22 + x23 + x31 mod 2

For x22:

x22 ≡ x21 + x23 + x12 + x32 mod 2

Wait, wait, let's re-express each equation properly.

Wait, the general equation is x_{i,j} ≡ [sum_{k≠j} x_{i,k} + sum_{k≠i} x_{k,j}] mod 2.

So for x11 (i=1,j=1):

sum_{k≠1} x_{1,k} = x12 + x13

sum_{k≠1} x_{k,1} = x21 + x31

Thus, x11 ≡ (x12 + x13) + (x21 + x31) mod 2

Similarly, for x12 (i=1,j=2):

sum_{k≠2} x_{1,k} = x11 + x13

sum_{k≠1} x_{k,2} = x22 + x32

Thus, x12 ≡ (x11 + x13) + (x22 + x32) mod 2

For x13 (i=1,j=3):

sum_{k≠3} x_{1,k} = x11 + x12

sum_{k≠1} x_{k,3} = x23 + x33

Thus, x13 ≡ (x11 + x12) + (x23 + x33) mod 2

For x21 (i=2,j=1):

sum_{k≠1} x_{2,k} = x22 + x23

sum_{k≠2} x_{k,1} = x11 + x31

Thus, x21 ≡ (x22 + x23) + (x11 + x31) mod 2

For x22 (i=2,j=2):

sum_{k≠2} x_{2,k} = x21 + x23

sum_{k≠2} x_{k,2} = x12 + x32

Thus, x22 ≡ (x21 + x23) + (x12 + x32) mod 2

For x23 (i=2,j=3):

sum_{k≠3} x_{2,k} = x21 + x22

sum_{k≠2} x_{k,3} = x13 + x33

Thus, x23 ≡ (x21 + x22) + (x13 + x33) mod 2

For x31 (i=3,j=1):

sum_{k≠1} x_{3,k} = x32 + x33

sum_{k≠3} x_{k,1} = x11 + x21

Thus, x31 ≡ (x32 + x33) + (x11 + x21) mod 2

For x32 (i=3,j=2):

sum_{k≠2} x_{3,k} = x31 + x33

sum_{k≠3} x_{k,2} = x12 + x22

Thus, x32 ≡ (x31 + x33) + (x12 + x22) mod 2

For x33 (i=3,j=3):

sum_{k≠3} x_{3,k} = x31 + x32

sum_{k≠3} x_{k,3} = x13 + x23

Thus, x33 ≡ (x31 + x32) + (x13 + x23) mod 2

So we have these 9 equations. This is a system of linear equations over GF(2), the field with two elements. Our variables are x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32, x33, each taking values 0 or 1.

Our goal is to find the number of solutions to this system. Once we find the number of solutions for the parities (x_{i,j}), then we can determine the possible grids. However, we need to check not only the parity conditions but also that the actual counts (V(i,j)) match the required counts. Because even if the parities are consistent, the actual values (0-4) must equal the counts. However, the counts are determined by the parities. Wait, let's think about this.

Once we have the parities (x_{i,j}), we can compute E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) for each cell, then V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). But for the solution to be valid, the value V(i,j) must be consistent with its parity. That is, V(i,j) must be even if x_{i,j}=0, and odd if x_{i,j}=1. However, since V(i,j) is calculated as E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j), which are counts (integers from 0 to 2 each, so sum from 0 to 4), we need to ensure that E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j) has the same parity as x_{i,j}. But in our previous derivation, we derived that x_{i,j} ≡ (E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j)) mod 2. Wait, but in the initial steps, we derived:

x_{i,j} ≡ (E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j)) mod 2

Which is exactly the parity of V(i,j). Since V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j), then x_{i,j} is the parity of V(i,j). Therefore, if we can find a parity assignment (x_{i,j}) that satisfies the system of equations, then for each cell, the count E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j) will have the correct parity. However, we also need to ensure that the actual count (the number) is equal to V(i,j). But how does that interact?

Wait, V(i,j) must equal E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). But E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) are computed based on the parities (x_{i,j}), since E_row(i,j) = number of evens in row i excluding (i,j). Since evens are cells with x_{i,k}=0. So, for each row i, the number of evens (E_row_i) is 3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{i,k}. Then, E_row(i,j) = E_row_i - (1 - x_{i,j}).

Similarly, E_col_j = 3 - sum_{k=1}^3 x_{k,j}, so E_col(i,j) = E_col_j - (1 - x_{i,j}).

Therefore, V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j) = [E_row_i - (1 - x_{i,j})] + [E_col_j - (1 - x_{i,j})] = E_row_i + E_col_j - 2*(1 - x_{i,j})

But 2*(1 - x_{i,j}) is even, so modulo 2, this is equivalent to E_row_i + E_col_j mod 2, which we already have as x_{i,j}.

But for the actual value, V(i,j) must equal E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). So even if the parities are correct, the actual values might not be integers in 0-4. Wait, but E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) are counts of evens, so they must be integers between 0 and 2 (since in a row of 3 cells, excluding one, you have 2 cells, so maximum 2 evens). Therefore, E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) are 0,1,2. So their sum is between 0 and 4. Therefore, V(i,j) is an integer between 0 and 4. Therefore, as long as we have the parities correct, and the system of equations is satisfied, the values V(i,j) must automatically be integers in 0-4, and thus valid. However, we also need to ensure that V(i,j) is equal to the count. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Once we have the parity assignments x_{i,j}, which satisfy the system of equations, then for each cell, V(i,j) is determined as E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). But E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) are computed from the x_{i,j} variables. Therefore, once we have x_{i,j}, we can compute E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) and thus V(i,j). However, the problem states that the value in each cell must be equal to E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). Therefore, as long as the system of equations is satisfied (the parity conditions), then the actual values computed from the x_{i,j} variables will be integers between 0 and 4, and they will have the correct parities. Therefore, each such parity assignment corresponds to exactly one valid grid. Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of parity assignments that satisfy the system of equations, multiplied by 1 (since each x assignment gives a unique grid). But wait, is that the case?

Wait, no. Because even with the parities fixed, the actual counts (E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j)) are determined by the x_{i,j}. However, different x assignments might lead to different counts even if the parities are the same. Wait, no. If we have two different x assignments, even if they have the same parities (i.e., same x_{i,j} values), they would lead to the same counts, because counts are based on the x_{i,j}. Therefore, each x assignment (satisfying the system) corresponds to exactly one grid where each V(i,j) is computed as E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j). Therefore, the number of valid grids is equal to the number of solutions to the system of equations for the x_{i,j} variables.

Therefore, if we can determine the number of solutions to the system of 9 equations, that will give us the number of valid grids. However, solving a system of 9 equations over GF(2) is non-trivial. Let's see if we can find dependencies or simplify the system.

First, notice that each equation links a cell to the sum of the other cells in its row and column. Let's check if there are dependencies among the equations. For example, let's consider the sum of all 9 equations. Each variable x_{i,j} appears in exactly two equations: once for its row and once for its column? Wait, no. Each variable x_{i,j} is the left-hand side (LHS) of one equation (its own equation), and appears in the right-hand side (RHS) of the equations for the other cells in its row and column.

Wait, no. Each equation for x_{i,j} includes the sum of other variables in its row and column. Therefore, each variable x_{i,j} is part of the RHS of the equations for the other cells in its row and column. For example, x11 is in the equations for x12, x13, x21, x31, etc.

However, summing all equations might lead to some simplification. Let's attempt to add all 9 equations modulo 2.

Sum of LHS: x11 + x12 + x13 + x21 + x22 + x23 + x31 + x32 + x33

Sum of RHS: For each equation, RHS is sum_{k≠j} x_{i,k} + sum_{k≠i} x_{k,j}. When we sum over all i and j, each term sum_{k≠j} x_{i,k} for all i,j is equivalent to summing over all i and all k≠j. Similarly, sum_{k≠i} x_{k,j} over all i,j is equivalent to summing over all j and all k≠i.

Wait, perhaps another approach. When we sum the RHS of all equations, each edge (connection between variables) is counted multiple times. Let me think:

Each x_{a,b} appears in the RHS of the equations for the other cells in row a and column b. For example, x11 appears in the RHS of the equations for x12, x13 (since they are in row 1) and in the equations for x21, x31 (since they are in column 1). Therefore, each x_{a,b} appears in 2 + 2 -1 = 3 equations? Wait:

Wait, x_{a,b} is in the equations for all cells in row a (except x_{a,b} itself) and all cells in column b (except x_{a,b} itself). So for each x_{a,b}, it's in (3-1) + (3-1) = 4 equations. Wait, in row a, there are 2 other cells (excluding x_{a,b}), and in column b, 2 other cells. Each of those 4 cells has an equation where x_{a,b} is part of the RHS. Therefore, each x_{a,b} appears in 4 equations on the RHS. Therefore, when we sum all RHS, each x_{a,b} is counted 4 times. Therefore, the total sum of RHS is 4*(x11 + x12 + ... + x33) mod 2. But 4 is 0 mod 2, so the total RHS sum is 0.

Sum of LHS is the sum of all variables. Sum of RHS is 0. Therefore, sum of variables ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore, the sum of all variables must be even. Therefore, any solution must have an even number of 1s (odd cells).

This is one constraint. But does the system have more constraints? Let's see.

Another approach is to find the rank of the system. The system has 9 variables and 9 equations. To find the number of solutions, we need to determine the rank of the coefficient matrix. The number of solutions is 2^(9 - rank). However, calculating the rank manually is tedious. Perhaps we can find dependencies among the equations.

Alternatively, notice that the equations are symmetric in some way. For example, flipping all bits (changing 0s to 1s and vice versa) would negate the equations, but since we're in GF(2), negation is the same as identity. However, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, let's try to assign values to some variables and see if we can solve for the others.

Let's start by assuming some variables and propagating the constraints.

For example, let's consider the equation for x11:

x11 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 mod 2

Suppose we set x11 = 0. Then 0 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 mod 2. Similarly, if we set x11 = 1, then 1 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 mod 2.

But without loss of generality, maybe we can fix some variables to reduce the system.

Alternatively, let's notice that the system might have dependencies. For example, if we add the equations for x11, x12, and x13 (the first row), maybe we can find a relation.

Let’s write the equations for the first row:

1. x11 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31
2. x12 = x11 + x13 + x22 + x32
3. x13 = x11 + x12 + x23 + x33

If we add these three equations mod 2:

x11 + x12 + x13 = (x12 + x13 + x21 + x31) + (x11 + x13 + x22 + x32) + (x11 + x12 + x23 + x33) mod 2

Simplify RHS:

x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 + x11 + x13 + x22 + x32 + x11 + x12 + x23 + x33

Combine like terms:

x11 appears twice: 2x11 ≡ 0

x12 appears twice: 2x12 ≡ 0

x13 appears twice: 2x13 ≡ 0

The remaining terms: x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 + x23 + x33

Therefore, RHS simplifies to (x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 + x23 + x33) mod 2

LHS is x11 + x12 + x13

Therefore:

x11 + x12 + x13 ≡ x21 + x22 + x23 + x31 + x32 + x33 mod 2

But x21 + x22 + x23 is the sum of the second row, and x31 + x32 + x33 is the sum of the third row. Let’s denote S1 = sum of row 1, S2 = sum of row 2, S3 = sum of row 3.

Then the equation becomes:

S1 ≡ S2 + S3 mod 2

But since S1 + S2 + S3 is the total number of 1s in the grid, which we already know must be even from the earlier constraint. Therefore, S1 + S2 + S3 ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore, S1 ≡ S2 + S3 mod 2. Therefore, the equation we derived is consistent with the total sum being even.

But this doesn't give a new constraint; it's a consequence of the total sum being even. Therefore, adding the first three equations gives a redundant equation.

Similarly, if we add the equations for the first column (x11, x21, x31), we might get another relation, but it would also be redundant.

This suggests that the system has dependencies, and the rank is less than 9. Let's try to see how many independent equations there are.

Let’s attempt to express some variables in terms of others.

Take the equation for x11:

x11 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 ... (1)

Equation for x12:

x12 = x11 + x13 + x22 + x32 ... (2)

Equation for x13:

x13 = x11 + x12 + x23 + x33 ... (3)

From equation (1), we can express x11 in terms of x12, x13, x21, x31.

From equation (2), we can express x12 in terms of x11, x13, x22, x32.

Substituting x11 from equation (1) into equation (2):

x12 = (x12 + x13 + x21 + x31) + x13 + x22 + x32 mod 2

Simplify:

x12 = x12 + 2x13 + x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 mod 2

Since 2x13 ≡ 0:

0 = x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 mod 2

=> x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 ≡ 0 ... (A)

Similarly, from equation (3):

x13 = x11 + x12 + x23 + x33

But x11 = x12 + x13 + x21 + x31. Substitute:

x13 = (x12 + x13 + x21 + x31) + x12 + x23 + x33 mod 2

Simplify:

x13 = 2x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 + x23 + x33 mod 2

Again, 2x12 ≡ 0:

0 = x21 + x31 + x23 + x33 mod 2 ... (B)

So from equations (1)-(3), we get two additional equations: (A) and (B).

Equation (A): x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 ≡ 0

Equation (B): x21 + x31 + x23 + x33 ≡ 0

Subtracting (A) from (B) gives:

(x21 + x31 + x23 + x33) - (x21 + x31 + x22 + x32) ≡ 0 - 0

Which simplifies to x23 + x33 - x22 - x32 ≡ 0

Or x23 + x33 + x22 + x32 ≡ 0 (since subtraction is addition mod 2)

So, x22 + x23 + x32 + x33 ≡ 0 ... (C)

Similarly, proceed with other equations.

This seems to be getting complicated. Maybe we can choose some variables as free variables and express others in terms of them.

Let’s assume that the variables in the first two rows and columns are free, and solve for the rest. For example, let’s consider variables x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32 as free variables, and x33 determined by them. But this might not work as x33 is involved in multiple equations.

Alternatively, choose variables in the first two rows and first two columns as free, and solve for the rest. Let’s try that.

Let’s fix the first two rows and first two columns:

x11, x12, x13,

x21, x22, x23,

x31, x32

We need to solve for x33.

From equation (C): x22 + x23 + x32 + x33 ≡ 0 => x33 = x22 + x23 + x32

Similarly, let's find equations involving x31, x32, and x33.

From equation for x31:

x31 = x32 + x33 + x11 + x21 ... (4)

But x33 = x22 + x23 + x32 from (C). Substitute into (4):

x31 = x32 + (x22 + x23 + x32) + x11 + x21 mod 2

Simplify:

x31 = 2x32 + x22 + x23 + x11 + x21 mod 2

Since 2x32 ≡ 0:

x31 = x22 + x23 + x11 + x21 ... (D)

Similarly, from equation for x32:

x32 = x31 + x33 + x12 + x22 ... (5)

But x33 = x22 + x23 + x32. Substitute into (5):

x32 = x31 + (x22 + x23 + x32) + x12 + x22 mod 2

Simplify:

x32 = x31 + x22 + x23 + x32 + x12 + x22 mod 2

Combine like terms:

x32 = x31 + 2x22 + x23 + x12 + x32 mod 2

Since 2x22 ≡ 0 and x23 + x12 are separate:

x32 = x31 + x23 + x12 + x32 mod 2

Subtract x32 from both sides:

0 = x31 + x23 + x12 mod 2 => x31 = x23 + x12 ... (E)

From equation (D): x31 = x22 + x23 + x11 + x21

From equation (E): x31 = x23 + x12

Therefore, equate them:

x23 + x12 = x22 + x23 + x11 + x21 mod 2

Cancel x23:

x12 = x22 + x11 + x21 mod 2 ... (F)

Similarly, this gives a relation among x12, x11, x21, x22.

This suggests that not all variables in the first two rows and columns are free. For example, x12 is determined by x11, x21, x22.

Let's try to fix some variables.

Let's set x11 = a, x12 = b, x13 = c,

x21 = d, x22 = e, x23 = f,

x31 = g, x32 = h,

and x33 = i.

From equation (C): i = e + f + h

From equation (D): g = e + f + a + d

From equation (E): g = f + b

Therefore, e + f + a + d = f + b => e + a + d = b ... (F)

From equation (F): b = a + d + e

From equation (A): x21 + x31 + x22 + x32 ≡ 0 => d + g + e + h ≡ 0

But g = f + b, so substitute:

d + (f + b) + e + h ≡ 0

From equation (F): b = a + d + e, so substitute:

d + f + (a + d + e) + e + h ≡ 0

Simplify:

d + f + a + d + e + e + h ≡ 0

Which simplifies to (2d) + (2e) + a + f + h ≡ 0 => a + f + h ≡ 0 ... (G)

From equation (B): x21 + x31 + x23 + x33 ≡ 0 => d + g + f + i ≡ 0

But g = f + b and i = e + f + h

So:

d + (f + b) + f + (e + f + h) ≡ 0

Simplify:

d + f + b + f + e + f + h ≡ 0 => d + b + e + 3f + h ≡ 0

Since 3f ≡ f mod 2:

d + b + e + f + h ≡ 0 ... (H)

But from equation (F): b = a + d + e. Substitute into (H):

d + (a + d + e) + e + f + h ≡ 0

Simplify:

d + a + d + e + e + f + h ≡ 0 => (2d) + a + (2e) + f + h ≡ 0 => a + f + h ≡ 0 ... (I)

Which is the same as equation (G). Therefore, equation (H) is redundant given (F) and (G).

So, we have the following constraints:

1. i = e + f + h ... (C)

2. g = e + f + a + d = f + b ... (D, E) => b = a + d + e ... (F)

3. a + f + h ≡ 0 ... (G)

Additionally, we need to consider the equations for the remaining variables.

For example, the equation for x13:

x13 = x11 + x12 + x23 + x33 => c = a + b + f + i

But i = e + f + h, so substitute:

c = a + b + f + e + f + h => c = a + b + e + h + 2f => c = a + b + e + h ... (J)

Similarly, the equation for x23:

x23 = x21 + x22 + x13 + x33 ... Wait, let's check the equation for x23.

The equation for x23 (i=2,j=3):

x23 ≡ sum_{k≠3} x_{2,k} + sum_{k≠2} x_{k,3} mod 2

sum_{k≠3} x_{2,k} = x21 + x22

sum_{k≠2} x_{k,3} = x13 + x33

Therefore, x23 ≡ x21 + x22 + x13 + x33 mod 2

Substitute known variables:

f ≡ d + e + c + i mod 2

But i = e + f + h, so:

f ≡ d + e + c + e + f + h mod 2

Simplify:

f ≡ d + 2e + c + f + h mod 2

Which becomes:

0 ≡ d + c + h mod 2 => d + c + h ≡ 0 ... (K)

But from equation (J): c = a + b + e + h. Substitute into (K):

d + (a + b + e + h) + h ≡ 0 => d + a + b + e + 2h ≡ 0 => d + a + b + e ≡ 0 ... (L)

But from equation (F): b = a + d + e. Substitute into (L):

d + a + (a + d + e) + e ≡ 0 => d + a + a + d + e + e ≡ 0 => 2d + 2a + 2e ≡ 0 => 0 ≡ 0. So this is always true. Therefore, equation (K) is redundant.

Similarly, let's check the equation for x31 (which is variable g):

From equation (4): x31 = x32 + x33 + x11 + x21 => g = h + i + a + d

But i = e + f + h, so:

g = h + (e + f + h) + a + d => g = e + f + a + d + 2h => g = e + f + a + d ... which matches equation (D). Therefore, this is consistent.

Now, let's check the equation for x32:

x32 = x31 + x33 + x12 + x22 => h = g + i + b + e

But g = e + f + a + d, i = e + f + h, so substitute:

h = (e + f + a + d) + (e + f + h) + b + e mod 2

Simplify:

h = e + f + a + d + e + f + h + b + e mod 2

Combine like terms:

h = (3e) + (2f) + a + d + b + h mod 2

Since 3e ≡ e, 2f ≡ 0:

h = e + a + d + b + h mod 2

Subtract h from both sides:

0 = e + a + d + b mod 2 ... (M)

But from equation (F): b = a + d + e. Substitute into (M):

0 = e + a + d + (a + d + e) mod 2

Simplify:

0 = e + a + d + a + d + e mod 2 => 0 = 2a + 2d + 2e mod 2 => 0 ≡ 0 mod 2. So redundant.

Finally, check the equation for x33:

x33 = x31 + x32 + x13 + x23 => i = g + h + c + f

But g = e + f + a + d, c = a + b + e + h, i = e + f + h

Substitute:

e + f + h = (e + f + a + d) + h + (a + b + e + h) + f mod 2

Simplify:

Left side: e + f + h

Right side: e + f + a + d + h + a + b + e + h + f

Combine terms:

Right side: 2e + 2f + 2a + d + b + 2h ≡ 0 + 0 + 0 + d + b + 0 ≡ d + b mod 2

Therefore, equation is:

e + f + h ≡ d + b mod 2

But from equation (F): b = a + d + e. Substitute:

e + f + h ≡ d + (a + d + e) mod 2 => e + f + h ≡ a + 2d + e mod 2 => f + h ≡ a mod 2

But from equation (G): a + f + h ≡ 0 => a ≡ f + h mod 2. Therefore, substituting into the above:

f + h ≡ f + h mod 2 => 0 ≡ 0. Therefore, redundant.

So, after all these substitutions, the only independent constraints we have are:

1. b = a + d + e ... (F)

2. a + f + h ≡ 0 ... (G)

3. i = e + f + h ... (C)

4. g = e + f + a + d ... (D)

5. c = a + b + e + h ... (J)

Additionally, we need to ensure that the remaining variables satisfy their equations. But as we saw, the remaining equations are either redundant or automatically satisfied given these constraints.

So, the free variables are: a, d, e, f, h.

Wait, let's check:

- a (x11) is free.

- d (x21) is free.

- e (x22) is free.

- f (x23) is free.

- h (x32) is free.

Variables b (x12), c (x13), g (x31), and i (x33) are determined by the constraints:

b = a + d + e ... (F)

c = a + b + e + h ... (J) => substitute b: c = a + (a + d + e) + e + h => c = 2a + d + 2e + h => c = d + h ... (since 2a and 2e are 0 mod 2)

g = e + f + a + d ... (D)

i = e + f + h ... (C)

Additionally, equation (G): a + f + h ≡ 0 ... which implies that h = a + f.

Therefore, h is determined by a and f.

Wait, yes! Equation (G): a + f + h ≡ 0 => h = a + f

Therefore, h is not free; it's determined by a and f.

Therefore, the free variables are a, d, e, f. Then h = a + f.

Then:

b = a + d + e

c = d + h = d + a + f

g = e + f + a + d

i = e + f + h = e + f + a + f = e + a

So, with a, d, e, f as free variables (each can be 0 or 1), and the other variables determined as above.

So, how many free variables? 4 variables, each binary: 2^4 = 16 possibilities.

But we also have the equation for x33 = i = e + a

But let's check if there are any further constraints. For example, the total sum must be even. Let's compute the total sum S = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i.

Substitute the variables:

b = a + d + e

c = d + a + f

g = e + f + a + d

h = a + f

i = e + a

Therefore:

S = a + (a + d + e) + (d + a + f) + d + e + f + (e + f + a + d) + (a + f) + (e + a)

Let's expand:

a + [a + d + e] + [d + a + f] + d + e + f + [e + f + a + d] + [a + f] + [e + a]

Combine like terms:

Count the number of a's: 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 7a

d's: 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5d

e's:1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5e

f's:1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5f

But wait, let's do it step by step:

First term: a

Second term: a + d + e

Third term: d + a + f

Fourth term: d

Fifth term: e

Sixth term: f

Seventh term: e + f + a + d

Eighth term: a + f

Ninth term: e + a

Now, sum all:

a +

(a + d + e) +

(d + a + f) +

d +

e +

f +

(e + f + a + d) +

(a + f) +

(e + a)

Now, collect terms:

a + a + a + a + a + a + a: a appears 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 7a

d + d + d + d + d: d appears 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5d

e + e + e + e + e: e appears 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5e

f + f + f + f + f: f appears 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 5f

But modulo 2, this is:

7a ≡ a mod 2

5d ≡ d mod 2

5e ≡ e mod 2

5f ≡ f mod 2

Therefore, total sum S ≡ a + d + e + f mod 2

But earlier, we know that the total sum must be even, so S ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore:

a + d + e + f ≡ 0 mod 2 ... (N)

This is an additional constraint. Therefore, out of the 16 possible combinations of a, d, e, f, those that satisfy a + d + e + f ≡ 0 are valid.

The number of solutions for a, d, e, f with a + d + e + f ≡ 0 is exactly half of 16, which is 8. Because for any three variables, the fourth is determined.

Therefore, there are 8 solutions. However, each solution determines the remaining variables, so total solutions are 8.

But wait, each solution for a, d, e, f with a + d + e + f ≡ 0 gives a unique assignment for b, c, g, h, i, and hence a unique grid. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 8.

But wait, each solution corresponds to a valid grid. However, we need to confirm that these grids satisfy all original equations, including the values being counts. However, as discussed earlier, if the parities are correct and the equations are satisfied, then the counts (values) are automatically valid integers in 0-4. Therefore, each of these 8 parity assignments corresponds to a valid grid.

Therefore, the number of self-describing 3x3 tables is 8.

But wait, let's sanity check. Let's take one solution and verify it.

Suppose we set a = 0, d = 0, e = 0, f = 0. Then a + d + e + f = 0, which satisfies (N).

Then:

h = a + f = 0 + 0 = 0

b = a + d + e = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

c = d + h = 0 + 0 = 0

g = e + f + a + d = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

i = e + a = 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, all variables are 0. Let's check if this satisfies the equations.

All cells are even (x_{i,j}=0). So every V(i,j) is the count of evens in row and column excluding itself. Since all cells are even, each row has 3 evens, so E_row(i,j) = 3 - 1 (since we exclude (i,j)) = 2. Similarly, E_col(i,j) = 2. Therefore, V(i,j) = 2 + 2 = 4. But 4 is even, which matches x_{i,j}=0. But wait, in reality, if all cells are 4, then each cell's value is 4. However, if all cells are 4, then each row has 3 evens (since 4 is even), so E_row(i,j) = 3 - 1 = 2, and similarly for column, so V(i,j) = 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, this is a valid solution. However, in this case, every cell is 4, which is even, so x_{i,j}=0 for all, which matches our assignment. So this is a valid solution.

Another example: Let’s choose a=1, d=0, e=0, f=1. Then a + d + e + f = 1+0+0+1=2≡0 mod 2, which satisfies (N).

Then:

h = a + f = 1 + 1 = 0

b = a + d + e = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1

c = d + h = 0 + 0 = 0

g = e + f + a + d = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2≡0

i = e + a = 0 + 1 = 1

So the variables are:

x11=1, x12=1, x13=0,

x21=0, x22=0, x23=1,

x31=0, x32=0, x33=1.

Let's check if this satisfies all equations.

For x11: should be 1. Compute RHS: x12 + x13 + x21 + x31 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 =1 ≡1. Correct.

For x12: 1. RHS: x11 + x13 + x22 + x32 =1 +0 +0 +0=1≡1. Correct.

For x13:0. RHS: x11 + x12 + x23 + x33=1+1+1+1=4≡0. Correct.

For x21:0. RHS: x22 + x23 + x11 + x31=0+1+1+0=2≡0. Correct.

For x22:0. RHS: x21 + x23 + x12 + x32=0+1+1+0=2≡0. Correct.

For x23:1. RHS: x21 + x22 + x13 + x33=0+0+0+1=1≡1. Correct.

For x31:0. RHS: x32 + x33 + x11 + x21=0+1+1+0=2≡0. Correct.

For x32:0. RHS: x31 + x33 + x12 + x22=0+1+1+0=2≡0. Correct.

For x33:1. RHS: x31 + x32 + x13 + x23=0+0+0+1=1≡1. Correct.

So this is a valid solution. Now, let's compute the actual values V(i,j):

For each cell (i,j):

V(i,j) = E_row(i,j) + E_col(i,j)

First, let's determine the parities. Our x variables are:

Row 1: 1,1,0 (so Evens in row 1: 1 even (x13=0))

Row 2:0,0,1 (Evens: 2 evens (x21=0, x22=0))

Row 3:0,0,1 (Evens: 2 evens (x31=0, x32=0))

Columns:

Column 1:1,0,0 (Evens:2 (x21=0, x31=0))

Column 2:1,0,0 (Evens:2 (x22=0, x32=0))

Column 3:0,1,1 (Evens:1 (x13=0))

Now compute E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j):

For cell (1,1) (x11=1):

E_row(1,1) = Evens in row 1 excluding (1,1): Evens are x12=1 (odd), x13=0 (even). So 1 even. So E_row(1,1)=1.

E_col(1,1) = Evens in column 1 excluding (1,1): column has 2 evens (x21=0, x31=0), excluding (1,1) which is odd, so still 2 evens. So E_col(1,1)=2.

Thus, V(1,1)=1+2=3. Since x11=1 (odd), this matches.

For cell (1,2) (x12=1):

E_row(1,2) = Evens in row 1 excluding (1,2): x11=1 (odd), x13=0 (even). So 1 even.

E_col(1,2) = Evens in column 2 excluding (1,2): column 2 has 2 evens (x22=0, x32=0), excluding (1,2) which is odd, so still 2 evens.

V(1,2)=1+2=3. x12=1 (odd), matches.

For cell (1,3) (x13=0):

E_row(1,3) = Evens in row 1 excluding (1,3): x11=1 (odd), x12=1 (odd). So 0 evens.

E_col(1,3) = Evens in column 3 excluding (1,3): column 3 has 1 even (x13=0), excluding (1,3), so 0 evens.

V(1,3)=0+0=0. x13=0, matches.

For cell (2,1) (x21=0):

E_row(2,1) = Evens in row 2 excluding (2,1): x22=0, x23=1. So 1 even.

E_col(2,1) = Evens in column 1 excluding (2,1): x11=1, x31=0. So 1 even.

V(2,1)=1+1=2. x21=0 (even), matches.

For cell (2,2) (x22=0):

E_row(2,2) = Evens in row 2 excluding (2,2): x21=0, x23=1. So 1 even.

E_col(2,2) = Evens in column 2 excluding (2,2): x12=1, x32=0. So 1 even.

V(2,2)=1+1=2. x22=0 (even), matches.

For cell (2,3) (x23=1):

E_row(2,3) = Evens in row 2 excluding (2,3): x21=0, x22=0. So 2 evens.

E_col(2,3) = Evens in column 3 excluding (2,3): x13=0, x33=1. So 1 even.

V(2,3)=2+1=3. x23=1 (odd), matches.

For cell (3,1) (x31=0):

E_row(3,1) = Evens in row 3 excluding (3,1): x32=0, x33=1. So 1 even.

E_col(3,1) = Evens in column 1 excluding (3,1): x11=1, x21=0. So 1 even.

V(3,1)=1+1=2. x31=0 (even), matches.

For cell (3,2) (x32=0):

E_row(3,2) = Evens in row 3 excluding (3,2): x31=0, x33=1. So 1 even.

E_col(3,2) = Evens in column 2 excluding (3,2): x12=1, x22=0. So 1 even.

V(3,2)=1+1=2. x32=0 (even), matches.

For cell (3,3) (x33=1):

E_row(3,3) = Evens in row 3 excluding (3,3): x31=0, x32=0. So 2 evens.

E_col(3,3) = Evens in column 3 excluding (3,3): x13=0, x23=1. So 1 even.

V(3,3)=2+1=3. x33=1 (odd), matches.

All values match, so this is a valid grid. Therefore, this solution is valid.

Thus, with 8 such solutions, each corresponding to a valid grid, the number of self-describing tables is 8.

But wait, the problem says "tables", so each cell has to have a number (V(i,j)), which is determined by the counts. But each x assignment (parity) determines the counts, which determine the numbers. Therefore, each solution to the parity equations gives exactly one valid table. Since there are 8 solutions, the answer is 8.

However, the answer is 8, but let's think again. Wait, the question is asking for the number of self-describing 3x3 tables. We found 8 solutions for the parity variables, each leading to a unique grid. But does each parity solution correspond to exactly one grid? Let's confirm.

Yes, because once we have the parities (x_{i,j}), we can compute E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) for each cell as:

E_row(i,j) = number of evens in row i excluding (i,j) = (number of evens in row i) - (1 if x_{i,j} is 0 else 0)

But the number of evens in row i is 3 - sum(x_{i,1} + x_{i,2} + x_{i,3}).

Similarly for E_col(i,j). Therefore, once the x_{i,j} are determined, the counts E_row(i,j) and E_col(i,j) can be computed, hence V(i,j) is determined. Therefore, each x solution corresponds to exactly one table.

Therefore, since there are 8 solutions, there are 8 such tables.

But wait, there's a possible mistake here. The system of equations for the parities gives us 8 solutions, but does each solution correspond to a unique table, or can different parity solutions lead to the same table?

No, because each x solution gives specific parities, which determine the counts, which determine the numbers. Since the numbers are directly computed from the x's, different x assignments would lead to different counts, hence different tables. Therefore, each x solution corresponds to a unique table.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

But let's check the total number of variables and equations. We had 9 variables, but through constraints, we reduced the free variables to 4 with one equation (N), leading to 8 solutions. This seems consistent.

Therefore, the number of self-describing 3x3 tables is 8.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{8}
