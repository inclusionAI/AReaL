"First, let's compute the circumcircle of ACQ. Points A(0,0), C(0,1), and Q(1 - p, p). Let me do similar steps.

Equation of the circle through A(0,0): x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0, so F=0.

Plugging in point C(0,1):

0 +1 + D*0 + E*1 =0 ⇒ 1 + E =0 ⇒ E = -1.

Plugging in point Q(1 - p, p):

(1 - p)^2 + p^2 + D*(1 - p) + E*p =0.

Substitute E = -1:

(1 - 2p + p²) + p² + D*(1 - p) - p =0

Simplify:

1 - 2p + p² + p² + D*(1 - p) - p =0

Combine terms:

2p² -3p +1 + D*(1 - p) =0

Solving for D:

D*(1 - p) = -2p² +3p -1

So,

D = [ -2p² +3p -1 ] / (1 - p )

Same numerator as before, so same steps:

-2p² +3p -1 = - (2p² -3p +1 ) = - (2p -1)(p -1 )

Thus,

D = [ - (2p -1)(p -1) ] / (1 - p ) = [ (2p -1)(1 - p) ] / (1 - p ) = 2p -1, provided 1 - p ≠0.

Therefore, D =2p -1, so the equation of the circle ACQ is x² + y² + (2p -1)x - y =0."</thread_processing>

"Now, moving on. Next step: E is the intersection of AP and IB, and F is the intersection of AQ and IC.

First, let's find equations for AP, IB, AQ, and IC.

First, let's find coordinates for points E and F.

First, let's find AP: from A(0,0) to P(p, 1 - p). Its parametric equation can be written as (tp, t(1 - p)), where t ranges from 0 to1.

IB is the line from incenter I(r, r) to B(1,0). Wait, in our coordinate system earlier, in a right-angled triangle at A(0,0) with B(1,0), C(0,1), the inradius r is (AB + AC - BC)/2 = (1 +1 - sqrt(2))/2, so approximately 0.2929, but let's just keep it as r = (2 - sqrt(2))/2.

Wait, but maybe we can compute it exactly. Let me recalculate inradius for this coordinate system.

In a right-angled triangle with legs a, b, hypotenuse c, inradius r = (a + b - c)/2. Here, a=1, b=1, c=√2, so r=(2 - √2)/2 ≈ 0.2929. So coordinates of I are (r, r).

Therefore, the coordinates of I are ((2 - √2)/2, (2 - √2)/2). Hmm, that's exact.

Alternatively, maybe we can keep r as a variable? Wait, but maybe in the coordinate system, since we set coordinates for A,B,C, perhaps we can work with variables.

Alternatively, since we set coordinates with A at (0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1), then the inradius is r=(1 +1 - sqrt(2))/2, so I is at (r,r). Let me denote r = (2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.2929.

But since we have variables in terms of p, maybe we can proceed symbolically.

First, let's find the equation of line IB.

Point I is (r, r), and point B is (1,0). The vector from I to B is (1 - r, -r). So parametric equation for IB is:

x = r + t(1 - r)

y = r + t(-r)

for t from 0 to1.

Similarly, the line AP is from (0,0) to (p, 1 - p). Its parametric equations are:

x = p*s

y = (1 - p)*s

for s from 0 to1.

We need to find E = AP ∩ IB. So set the coordinates equal:

p*s = r + t*(1 - r)

(1 - p)*s = r - t*r

We have two equations:

1) p*s - t*(1 - r) = r

2) (1 - p)*s + t*r = r

We can solve for s and t.

Let me write equations:

From equation 1:

p s - (1 - r)t = r ...(1)

From equation 2:

(1 - p)s + r t = r ...(2)

Let me solve equations (1) and (2) for s and t.

Let me write equations in matrix form:

[ p - (1 - r) ] [s] = [ r ]

[ (1-p) r ] [t] [ r ]

Let me compute determinant of the matrix:

D = p * r - ( - (1 - r) )*(1 - p ) = p r + (1 - r)(1 - p )

Compute D:

pr + (1 - p - r + pr ) = pr +1 - p - r + pr = 1 - p - r + 2 pr

Hmm, not sure if helpful. Maybe solve via substitution.

From equation (2): Let's solve for t:

r t = r - (1 - p)s ⇒ t = [ r - (1 - p)s ] / r

Substitute into equation (1):

p s - (1 - r)*[ ( r - (1 - p)s ) / r ] = r

Multiply through by r to eliminate denominators:

p r s - (1 - r)( r - (1 - p)s ) = r^2

Expand the second term:

- (1 - r)*r + (1 - r)(1 - p)s

Thus:

p r s - (1 - r)r + (1 - r)(1 - p)s = r^2

Combine terms with s:

[ p r + (1 - r)(1 - p) ] s = r^2 + (1 - r)r

Compute coefficient of s:

p r + (1 - r)(1 - p ) = p r + (1 - p - r + p r )

= 1 - p - r + 2 p r

Right-hand side:

r^2 + r - r^2 = r

Wait, let's compute RHS:

r^2 + (1 - r)r = r^2 + r - r^2 = r.

Therefore:

[1 - p - r + 2 p r ] s = r

Thus,

s = r / [1 - p - r + 2 p r ]

Hmm, complicated. Let me note that this expression for s is the parameter along AP where point E is located.

Similarly, once we have s, we can find coordinates of E as (p s, (1 - p)s )

Similarly, we can find F by repeating the process for AQ and IC.

But this seems getting very algebra-heavy. Maybe there's a better approach?

Alternatively, perhaps choosing specific coordinates where calculations are easier. Since in the current coordinate system, things are getting messy because of the inradius. Maybe choosing a different coordinate system where the inradius is simpler?

Alternatively, let me choose ABC as an isoceles triangle where AB=AC, so that the angle bisector is also the median and altitude, which might make things symmetric.

Let me try that. Let me set ABC as an isoceles triangle with AB=AC=1, and angle at A being, say, 90 degrees again? Wait, but maybe 60 degrees?

Alternatively, let me take an isoceles triangle with AB=AC=2, and BC=2 as well, making it equilateral. But then inradius is known, but perhaps symmetry will help.

Wait, let me choose triangle ABC with AB=AC=1, angle at A is 60 degrees, so it's an equilateral triangle. Wait, no, in an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60, so AB=AC=BC.

Alternatively, let me choose triangle ABC with coordinates A at (0,0), B at (1,0), and C at (-1,0), making it isoceles with AB=AC. Wait, but then BC would be the base. Hmm, maybe that complicates.

Alternatively, let me take ABC as an isoceles triangle with AB=AC= some length, and base BC. Let me set coordinates as follows:

Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (-1,0), point C at (1,0). Wait, then BC is the base from (-1,0) to (1,0), and A is at (0, h) for some h. Hmm, but then angle at A is determined by h.

Alternatively, set ABC with coordinates:

Let me choose ABC such that it's isoceles with AB=AC=2, angle at A is 90 degrees, so coordinates:

A(0,0), B(1,1), C(-1,1). Hmm, then AB and AC would have length sqrt(2). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.

Wait, in my first coordinate system, even though the algebra is complex, perhaps I can proceed, given that D is at (1/(2p),1/(2p)), which is on y=x, the angle bisector. Also, the incenter I is at (r, r), so along y=x as well. So points D and I are both on the angle bisector. Therefore, line DI is along y=x. Therefore, the line DI is the angle bisector itself. Wait, but in our coordinate system, DI is from D(1/(2p),1/(2p)) to I(r, r). Since both points are on y=x, the line DI is just the line y=x. Therefore, the line EF must intersect DI (which is y=x) at point G. Therefore, the point G is the intersection of EF and y=x.

Therefore, if we can find coordinates of E and F, then find EF's equation, and find its intersection with y=x, which is G, then compute the ratio EG/GF.

Alternatively, since DI is along y=x, and G is on DI, so G is on y=x. Therefore, the coordinates of G must satisfy y=x, so to find G, we can parametrize EF and find where it crosses y=x.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a ratio that is constant regardless of p? The problem is asking for the ratio EG/GF, which might be 1, given the symmetry of the problem.

Alternatively, let's proceed with the coordinate system and see if the ratio is indeed 1.

Let me proceed step by step with the first coordinate system (right-angled at A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1)), in which case the inradius is r = (2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.2929.

Let me assign a specific value to p to simplify calculations. Since the problem might hold for any p, so choosing a specific p could help us compute the ratio.

Let me choose p =1/2. Let me see what happens when P is the midpoint of BC.

If p=1/2, then P is (0.5, 0.5), since BC is from (1,0) to (0,1). Then Q, being the reflection over y=x, would be (1 -1/2,1/2) = (0.5,0.5). Wait, so P and Q coincide? That can't be, unless p=1/2 makes Q=P. Wait, but if p=1/2, then Q would be (1 - 0.5, 0.5) = (0.5, 0.5), same as P. So in this case, P and Q are the same point. But the problem states points P and Q on BC such that AP and AQ are isogonal conjugates. If they coincide, then AP is its own isogonal conjugate, which would mean it's symmetric over the angle bisector, so AP must be the angle bisector itself. Indeed, when P is the midpoint, AP is the median, but in a right-angled triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse, but is it the angle bisector?

Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the angle bisector of the right angle is the line y=x, which goes to the incenter. The midpoint of BC is (0.5,0.5), which is on y=x, so indeed, AP in this case is the angle bisector. So that case is valid.

However, in this case, points P and Q coincide, so lines AQ and AP are the same, so E and F would be intersections of AP with IB and IC. Since AP is the angle bisector, which is AI, so E would be the intersection of AI and IB, which is I itself? Wait, AP is AI here, so E is where AI meets IB, which is I. Similarly, F would be where AQ (same as AP) meets IC, which is also I. Therefore, points E and F both coincide with I, so line EF is undefined, or a point. So this case is degenerate. So p=1/2 is not a good choice.

Let me choose another p, say p=1/3. Let me set p=1/3.

So P is (1/3, 2/3), since x + y =1 on BC.

Then Q would be (1 -1/3,1/3)= (2/3,1/3).

Now, let's compute D's coordinates. Earlier, we found D is (1/(2p),1/(2p)). With p=1/3, D is (3/2, 3/2). Wait, but in our coordinate system, the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1). So D is at (1.5,1.5), which is outside the triangle, which is okay.

Now, let's compute E and F.

First, compute E = AP ∩ IB.

AP goes from (0,0) to (1/3, 2/3). Let me parametrize AP as (t/3, 2t/3), where t ranges from 0 to1.

IB is the line from incenter I(r,r) to B(1,0). Let me compute coordinates of I first.

Given inradius r=(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.2929, so numerically, r≈0.2929. Let me keep it exact for now.

Coordinates of I are (r, r) = ( (2 - sqrt(2))/2, (2 - sqrt(2))/2 ).

Equation of IB: from (r,r) to (1,0). Let's find parametric equations for IB.

Parametrize with parameter s from 0 to1:

x = r + s(1 - r)

y = r + s(-r)

So,

x = r + s(1 - r)

y = r (1 - s )

We need to find E where AP intersects IB.

AP parametrized as ( t/3, 2t/3 )

Set equal to IB's coordinates:

t/3 = r + s(1 - r )

2t/3 = r (1 - s )

We can solve for s and t.

From the second equation:

2t/3 = r - r s ⇒ rearrange to solve for s:

r s = r - 2t/3 ⇒ s = 1 - (2t)/(3r)

Substitute into first equation:

t/3 = r + [1 - (2t)/(3r) ] (1 - r )

Expand the right-hand side:

r + (1 - r) - (1 - r)(2t)/(3r )

Simplify:

r +1 - r - (2t(1 - r))/(3r )

= 1 - (2t(1 - r))/(3r )

Thus:

t/3 =1 - [2t(1 - r)/(3r) ]

Bring all terms to left:

t/3 + [2t(1 - r)/(3r) ] =1

Factor t:

t [ 1/3 + 2(1 - r)/(3r) ] =1

Compute the coefficient:

Let me compute:

1/3 + [2(1 - r)]/(3r) = [ r + 2(1 - r) ] / (3r )

Wait, let me do step by step:

Common denominator is 3r:

[ (1/3)*(r) + 2(1 - r) ] / (3r )

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

1/3 = (r)/(3r)

Thus,

1/3 + [2(1 - r)/(3r) ] = [ r + 2(1 - r) ] / (3r )

= [ r + 2 - 2r ] / (3r )

= [ 2 - r ] / (3r )

Thus,

t*(2 - r)/(3r ) =1 ⇒ t= [3r/(2 - r) ]

Therefore,

t= 3r/(2 - r )

Then, coordinates of E are:

x = t/3 = r/(2 - r )

y= 2t/3 = 2r/(2 - r )

So E is ( r/(2 - r ), 2r/(2 - r ) )"</thread_processing>

"Similarly, compute F = AQ ∩ IC.

AQ is from A(0,0) to Q(2/3,1/3). Parametrizing AQ as (2t/3, t/3 ), t from 0 to1.

IC is the line from incenter I(r,r) to C(0,1). Let's parametrize IC.

Parametrize with parameter u from 0 to1:

x = r - r u

y = r + (1 - r ) u

So,

x = r(1 - u )

y = r + (1 - r )u

Set equal to AQ's coordinates (2t/3, t/3 )

Thus,

2t/3 = r(1 - u )

t/3 = r + (1 - r )u

Solve for u and t.

From first equation: u =1 - (2t)/(3r )

Substitute into second equation:

t/3 = r + (1 - r )(1 - (2t)/(3r) )

Expand the RHS:

r + (1 - r ) - (1 - r)(2t)/(3r )

Simplify:

1 - (2t(1 - r))/(3r )

Thus,

t/3 =1 - [2t(1 - r )/(3r) ]

Same as before, bring all terms to left:

t/3 + [2t(1 - r )/(3r ) ] =1

Factor t:

t [ 1/3 + 2(1 - r )/(3r ) ] =1

Which is the same coefficient as before:

[1/3 + 2(1 - r )/(3r ) ] = (2 - r )/(3r )

Thus,

t*(2 - r )/(3r ) =1 ⇒ t= 3r/(2 - r )

Same t as before. Therefore,

x= 2t/3 = 2r/(2 - r )

y= t/3 = r/(2 - r )

<thread_processing id = '13'>
:

First, let's find the tangent at B to circle ABP. Points A(0,0), B(1,0), and P(p, 1 - p). Let me compute the circumcircle of these three points.

The general equation of a circle through A(0,0) is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Since it passes through (0,0), F = 0.

So equation: x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Now, plugging in point B(1,0):

1² + 0 + D*1 + E*0 = 0 ⇒ 1 + D = 0 ⇒ D = -1.

Plugging in point P(p, 1 - p):

p² + (1 - p)^2 + D*p + E*(1 - p) = 0.

Substitute D = -1:

p² + (1 - 2p + p²) + (-1)*p + E*(1 - p) = 0

Simplify:

p² + 1 - 2p + p² - p + E(1 - p) = 0

Combine like terms:

2p² - 3p + 1 + E(1 - p) = 0

Solving for E:

E(1 - p ) = -2p² + 3p -1

Thus,

E = (-2p² + 3p -1)/(1 - p)

Let me factor numerator:

-2p² + 3p -1 = -(2p² - 3p +1) = -(2p -1)(p -1). Let me check:

(2p -1)(p -1) = 2p² -2p - p +1 = 2p² -3p +1. Yes, so numerator is - (2p -1)(p -1). Therefore,

E = [ - (2p -1)(p -1) ] / (1 - p) = [ (2p -1)(1 - p) ] / (1 - p) ) = (2p -1). Because (p -1) = -(1 - p), so the negatives cancel.

Wait, let me re-express:

Numerator: - (2p -1)(p -1) = - (2p -1)(- (1 - p)) = (2p -1)(1 - p)

So numerator is (2p -1)(1 - p), denominator is (1 - p), so E = 2p -1, provided that 1 - p ≠0, which is true unless p=1, which would be point B itself, but P is on BC, so p is between 0 and1, but not necessarily 1.

Therefore, E = 2p -1.

Thus, the equation of the circle ABP is:

x² + y² - x + (2p -1)y =0.

Now, to find the tangent at point B(1,0). The tangent at a point (x0,y0) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:

xx0 + yy0 + D(x + x0)/2 + E(y + y0)/2 + F =0 ?

Wait, perhaps better to use the derivative or the formula for tangent.

Alternatively, the tangent at B(1,0) can be found using the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point. The center of the circle ABP is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). Since D = -1 and E = 2p -1,

Center is at ( 1/2, (1 - 2p)/2 )

Therefore, the radius vector from center to B(1,0) is (1 - 1/2, 0 - (1 - 2p)/2 ) = (1/2, (2p -1)/2 )

Therefore, the tangent line at B is perpendicular to this radius. The direction vector of the radius is (1/2, (2p -1)/2 ), so the tangent line has a direction perpendicular to that, so slope is negative reciprocal.

Slope of radius: [( (2p -1)/2 ) / (1/2) ] = (2p -1)/1 = 2p -1. Therefore, slope of tangent is -1/(2p -1).

Therefore, the tangent at B has slope -1/(2p -1). Since it passes through (1,0), the equation is:

"Now, the tangent at point C(0,1). Let's find its equation.

First, the center of the circle ACQ is at (-D/2, -E/2) = ( -(2p -1)/2 , -(-1)/2 ) = ( (1 - 2p)/2, 1/2 )

The radius vector from center to C(0,1) is (0 - (1 - 2p)/2, 1 - 1/2 ) = ( (2p -1)/2, 1/2 )

Therefore, the slope of the radius is [ (1/2) / ( (2p -1)/2 ) ] = 1/(2p -1). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular, so slope is - (2p -1).

Hence, the tangent line at C has slope - (2p -1), and passes through (0,1). So equation is:

y -1 = - (2p -1)(x -0 )

Thus, y = - (2p -1)x +1."</thread_processing>

"Interesting, so coordinates of E and F are swapped in x and y components.

Therefore, E is ( r/(2 - r ), 2r/(2 - r ) )

F is ( 2r/(2 - r ), r/(2 - r ) )

Therefore, the line EF connects these two points. Let me compute the equation of line EF.

First, compute the slope:

m = [ y_F - y_E ] / [ x_F - x_E ]

Compute y_F - y_E:

[ r/(2 - r ) - 2r/(2 - r ) ] = - r/(2 - r )

x_F - x_E:

[ 2r/(2 - r ) - r/(2 - r ) ] = r/(2 - r )

Thus slope m = ( - r/(2 - r ) ) / ( r/(2 - r ) ) = -1

So line EF has slope -1.

Equation of line EF: using point E:

y - y_E = -1 (x - x_E )

So,

y - [2r/(2 - r ) ] = - (x - [ r/(2 - r ) ] )

Simplify:

y = -x + r/(2 - r ) + 2r/(2 - r ) = -x + 3r/(2 - r )

Thus, equation of EF is y = -x + 3r/(2 - r )"</thread_processing>
