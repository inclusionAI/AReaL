Test Question: A company was contracted to construct three buildings, with the second building being two times as tall as the first building. The third building had to be three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings. If the first building was 600 feet, calculate the total height of the three buildings together.

Model Response:
Let's start by identifying the given information. The height of the first building is 600 feet.

Next, the second building is two times as tall as the first building, so I calculate its height by multiplying 600 feet by 2, which gives 1200 feet.

Then, the third building is three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings. I add the heights of the first and second buildings to get 1800 feet and then multiply that sum by 3 to find the height of the third building, which is 5400 feet.

Finally, to find the total height of all three buildings together, I add up the heights of each building: 600 feet + 1200 feet + 5400 feet, resulting in a total of 7200 feet.
\boxed{7200}

Test Question: Find the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$

Model Response:
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) such that \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \). Hmm, let's start by understanding what this means. 

First, numbers in a certain base \( b \) can be converted to decimal (base 10) by expanding their digits. For example, the number \( 17_b \) would be equal to \( 1 \times b + 7 \times 1 \) in decimal, right? Similarly, \( 97_b \) would be \( 9 \times b + 7 \times 1 \) in decimal. 

So, if \( 17_b \) divides \( 97_b \), then the decimal equivalent of \( 97_b \) divided by the decimal equivalent of \( 17_b \) should be an integer. Let me write that down:

Let \( N = 17_b = 1 \times b + 7 \times 1 = b + 7 \).

Let \( M = 97_b = 9 \times b + 7 \times 1 = 9b + 7 \).

We need \( N \) to divide \( M \), so \( \frac{M}{N} \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( \frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} \) should be an integer. Let me compute this fraction:

\( \frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} \).

Hmm, maybe I can perform polynomial division here. Let's divide \( 9b + 7 \) by \( b + 7 \). 

Dividing 9b by b gives 9, so:

\( 9b + 7 = 9 \times (b + 7) + (7 - 63) \).

Wait, let me check that again. If I multiply 9 by (b + 7), I get 9b + 63. Then subtract that from 9b + 7:

\( (9b + 7) - 9 \times (b + 7) = 9b + 7 - 9b - 63 = -56 \).

So, \( \frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = 9 + \frac{-56}{

The third building had to be three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings. If the first building was 600 feet, calculate the total height of the three buildings together.

First, determine the height of the second building by multiplying the height of the first building by 2.

Next, calculate the combined height of the first and second buildings.

Then, determine the height of the third building by multiplying the combined height by 3.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Height of the First Building**:
   - The first building is given as **600 feet**.
   
2. **Height of the Second Building**:
   - The second building is **two times as tall as the first building**.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 600\, \text{feet} = 1,200\, \text{feet} \).

3. **Combined Height of First and Second Buildings**:
   - Add the heights of the first and second buildings.
   - Calculation: \( 600\, \text{feet} + 1,200\, \text{feet} = 1,800\, \text{feet} \).

4. **Height of the Third Building**:
   - The third building is **three times as tall as the combined height of the first and second buildings**.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 1,800\, \text{feet} = 5,400\, \text{feet} \).

5. **Total Height of All Three Buildings**:
   - Add the heights of all three buildings together.
   - Calculation: \( 600\, \text{feet} + 1,200\, \text{feet} + 5,400\, \text{feet} = 7,200\, \text{feet} \).

**Final Answer**: \(\boxed{7200\, \text{feet}}\)
\boxed{7200\, \text{feet}}
