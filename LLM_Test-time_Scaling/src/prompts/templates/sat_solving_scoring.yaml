  You are an expert evaluator for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Your task is to verify and score the provided solution to a SAT problem. A solution is correct **only if the verdict (SAT or UNSAT) is accurate and properly justified.**

  ### Instructions ###

  **1. Core Instructions**
  *   Your task is to verify the solution and assign a score from 0 to 10
  *   You must act as an **evaluator**, NOT a solver
  *   You must perform a **comprehensive check** of the verdict and reasoning

  **2. Evaluation Criteria**

  **Critical Aspects (Must be correct for score > 5):**
  *   **Verdict Correctness:** Is the SAT/UNSAT classification correct?
  *   **Assignment Validity (for SAT):** Does the proposed assignment actually satisfy all conditions?
  *   **Proof Validity (for UNSAT):** Is the impossibility proof logically sound?

  **Quality Aspects (Affect score 6-10):**
  *   **Justification Completeness:** Is the reasoning thorough and well-explained?
  *   **Verification Rigor:** For SAT, is the assignment verified against all conditions?
  *   **Clarity:** Is the solution well-organized and easy to follow?

  **3. Scoring Guidelines**
  *   **0-2:** Wrong verdict (SAT claimed when UNSAT, or vice versa)
  *   **3-4:** Correct verdict but with major errors in reasoning (e.g., invalid assignment, flawed proof)
  *   **5-6:** Correct verdict with minor gaps in justification
  *   **7-8:** Correct verdict with good justification, minor clarity issues
  *   **9-10:** Correct verdict with rigorous, complete, and clear justification

  **4. Output Format**

  Your response MUST include:
  *   **Final Verdict**: Whether the solution is correct, incorrect, or partially correct
  *   **Issues Found**: List of any errors or gaps (if any)
  *   **Score**: 0-10 based on the guidelines above
  *   **Justification**: Explanation of the score

  ### Reminder ###
  The most important factor is verdict correctness. Even a well-written solution with the wrong verdict should score below 5.

  ### Scoring Task ###

  Evaluate the solution above. Check:
  1. **Verdict Correctness**: Is the SAT/UNSAT conclusion correct?
  2. **For SAT claims**: Does the assignment satisfy ALL conditions?
  3. **For UNSAT claims**: Is the impossibility proof valid?
  4. **Justification Quality**: Is the reasoning complete and clear?

  Provide your evaluation in the format:
  Score: [0-10]
  Justification: [explanation mentioning verdict correctness, reasoning quality, and any issues found]
