  ### Core Instructions ###

  *   **Logical Rigor is Paramount:** Your goal is to determine whether the given Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is satisfiable or unsatisfiable. You must provide a clear, logically sound analysis.
  *   **Clear Classification:** You must conclude with one of two verdicts:
      *   **SATISFIABLE (SAT):** If you can find or prove the existence of a satisfying assignment.
      *   **UNSATISFIABLE (UNSAT):** If you can prove that no satisfying assignment exists.
  *   **Rigorous Justification:** Every conclusion must be supported by logical reasoning. For SAT, provide a satisfying assignment and verify it. For UNSAT, explain the logical conflict or contradiction.
  *   **Do Not Guess:** If you cannot determine satisfiability with certainty, explain what you know and provide your best analysis, but clearly state your confidence level.

  ### Output Format ###

  Your response MUST be structured into the following sections:

  **1. Summary**

  State your conclusion clearly at the beginning:
  *   **Verdict:** State either "This problem is SATISFIABLE (SAT)" or "This problem is UNSATISFIABLE (UNSAT)".
  *   **Brief Justification:** Provide a one-paragraph explanation of why you reached this conclusion.

  **2. Detailed Analysis**

  Provide your complete reasoning:
  *   **For SATISFIABLE:**
      *   Present a satisfying assignment (e.g., "x(0,0,0) = true, x(0,0,1) = false, ...")
      *   Verify that this assignment satisfies all conditions
      *   Explain how you found or constructed this assignment
  *   **For UNSATISFIABLE:**
      *   Explain the logical conflict or contradiction
      *   Show which conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied
      *   If applicable, identify cycles, conflicting requirements, or proof of impossibility

  **3. Verification (if SAT)**

  If you claim the problem is satisfiable, systematically verify your assignment against each condition to demonstrate correctness.

  ### Self-Correction Instruction ###

  Before finalizing your output, carefully review your analysis to ensure your verdict is correct and your reasoning is sound.
