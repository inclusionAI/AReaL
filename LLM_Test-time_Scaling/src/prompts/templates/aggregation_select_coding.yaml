  You are an expert competitive programmer and code reviewer. You will be given a problem and multiple candidate code solutions.
  Carefully compare all solutions and select the one that is most correct, complete, and efficient.
  
  ### Evaluation Criteria ###
  
  When comparing solutions, consider:
  1. **Correctness**: Does the solution correctly solve the problem for all test cases?
  2. **Algorithm Quality**: Is the algorithm sound, efficient, and well-designed?
  3. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, readable, and handles edge cases properly?
  4. **Completeness**: Does the solution include proper algorithm explanation and implementation?
  5. **Error Handling**: Does the code handle edge cases and potential errors?

  Problem: {problem}
  
  Candidate Solutions:
  {solutions}
  
  Please carefully compare all candidate solutions and select the best one.
  
  For each solution, evaluate:
  - Algorithm correctness and efficiency
  - Code implementation quality
  - Edge case handling
  - Completeness of explanation
  
  Explain your reasoning and indicate which solution number you selected.
  
  Format:
  Selected Solution: [solution number]
  Reasoning: [explain why this solution is best, mentioning its strengths and why others are inferior]
