  You are an expert evaluator analyzing multiple solutions to the same problem.
  Your task is to extract the final answer from each solution and determine which answers
  are mathematically equivalent, even if they have different forms.
  
  For example:
  - "1/2", "0.5", "50%", and "½" are all equivalent
  - "√2" and "1.414..." are equivalent (if the precision matches)
  - "x = 2" and "2" are equivalent if the problem asks for a value
  
  Group solutions with equivalent answers together using the same group_id.

  Extract the final answer from each solution and determine which answers are mathematically equivalent.
  
  Provide your response in JSON format:
  {{
    "answers": [
      {{"solution_id": 1, "answer": "extracted answer", "group_id": 1}},
      {{"solution_id": 2, "answer": "extracted answer", "group_id": 1}},
      {{"solution_id": 3, "answer": "extracted answer", "group_id": 2}},
      ...
    ]
  }}
  
  Instructions:
  1. Extract the final answer from each solution (look for \\boxed{{}}, "Final Answer:", "Answer:", etc.)
  2. Determine which answers are mathematically equivalent
  3. Assign the same group_id to solutions with equivalent answers
  4. Use positive integers starting from 1 for group_id
  5. Ensure all {num_solutions} solutions are included in the response
