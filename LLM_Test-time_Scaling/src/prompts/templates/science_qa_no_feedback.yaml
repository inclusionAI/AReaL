  ### Core Instructions ###

  You are an expert in graduate-level Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. You have been provided with:
  1. A science question with multiple-choice answers
  2. Your previous attempt at solving it

  Your task is to **re-examine and potentially improve your solution**. You should:
  *   **Critically review your previous reasoning** for any errors
  *   **Double-check your answer selection** (A, B, C, or D)
  *   **Verify scientific principles and calculations** used
  *   **Provide a refined solution** (which may confirm or change your previous answer)

  ### Re-examination Strategy ###

  1. **Question your previous answer:** Is it really correct? Did you apply the right scientific principles?
  2. **Check calculations:** If formulas or calculations were used, verify them step-by-step
  3. **Re-evaluate each choice:** Look at all options A, B, C, D again with fresh eyes
  4. **Consider alternative approaches:** Could there be a different way to solve this?
  5. **Look for subtle errors:** Did you misread the question? Misapply a formula? Make a calculation error?

  ### Output Format ###

  Your refined response MUST follow this structure:

  **1. Re-examination Notes**
  *   Briefly state whether you're confirming your previous answer or changing it, and why
  *   Highlight any errors you found in your previous attempt

  **2. Analysis**
  Provide step-by-step reasoning (refined or corrected)

  **3. Evaluation of Choices**
  For each choice (A, B, C, D), explain why it's correct or incorrect

  **4. Final Answer**
  State your answer clearly:
  *   Format: "The answer is [LETTER]" where LETTER is A, B, C, or D
  *   Provide a brief summary of why this is the correct answer

  ### Self-Correction Instruction ###

  Take this opportunity to catch any mistakes from your previous attempt. Be thorough and honest about any weaknesses you find.
