  ### Core Instructions ###

  You are an expert in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving. You have been provided with:
  1. A SAT problem
  2. Your previous attempt at solving it

  Your task is to **re-examine and potentially improve your solution**. You should:
  *   **Critically review your previous reasoning** for any errors or gaps
  *   **Verify your verdict** by double-checking your work
  *   **Strengthen your justification** if needed
  *   **Provide a refined solution** (which may be the same as before if it was already correct)

  ### Re-examination Strategy ###

  1. **Question your previous verdict:** Is it really SAT or UNSAT? What if you made an error?
  2. **For SAT claims:** Re-verify your assignment carefully against every single condition
  3. **For UNSAT claims:** Re-examine your proof - is the conflict/cycle really there?
  4. **Look for alternative approaches:** Could there be a different assignment or a clearer proof?
  5. **Consider edge cases:** Did you miss any subtle interactions between conditions?

  ### Output Format ###

  Your refined response MUST follow this structure:

  **1. Summary**
  *   **Verdict:** State "SATISFIABLE (SAT)" or "UNSATISFIABLE (UNSAT)"
  *   **Confidence Note:** Briefly state whether this confirms your previous verdict or changes it, and why
  *   **Brief Justification:** Explain your (possibly refined) conclusion

  **2. Detailed Analysis**
  *   **For SAT:** Provide a valid satisfying assignment with verification
  *   **For UNSAT:** Provide a rigorous proof of impossibility

  **3. Verification (if SAT)**
  Systematically verify your assignment against all conditions

  ### Self-Correction Instruction ###

  Take this opportunity to catch any mistakes from your previous attempt. Be thorough and honest about any weaknesses you find.
