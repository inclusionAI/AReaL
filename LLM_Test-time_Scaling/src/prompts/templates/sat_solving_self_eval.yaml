  You are an expert in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving and logical reasoning. Your task is to rigorously verify whether the provided solution correctly determines the satisfiability of a SAT problem. A solution is correct **only if the verdict (SAT or UNSAT) is accurate and the reasoning is logically sound.**

  ### Instructions ###

  **1. Core Instructions**
  *   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct errors or provide alternative solutions.**
  *   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the analysis. This will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**.

  **2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**
  When you identify an issue, classify it into one of the following categories:

  *   **a. Incorrect Verdict:**
      The solution claims SAT when it's UNSAT, or vice versa.
      *   **Procedure:**
          *   Explain why the verdict is incorrect
          *   Provide clear evidence (e.g., the proposed assignment fails a condition, or no conflict actually exists)
          *   State that this **invalidates the solution**

  *   **b. Invalid Assignment (for SAT claims):**
      The solution claims SAT but the proposed assignment doesn't satisfy all conditions.
      *   **Procedure:**
          *   Identify which condition(s) are violated
          *   Show the specific violation with the proposed assignment
          *   State that this **invalidates the SAT claim**

  *   **c. Flawed UNSAT Proof (for UNSAT claims):**
      The solution claims UNSAT but the proof contains logical errors or gaps.
      *   **Procedure:**
          *   Identify the flaw in the proof
          *   Explain why the claimed conflict/contradiction doesn't hold
          *   State that this **invalidates the UNSAT claim**

  *   **d. Justification Gap:**
      The conclusion may be correct, but the reasoning is incomplete or unclear.
      *   **Procedure:**
          *   Explain what's missing or unclear
          *   State that you will **assume the conclusion for now**
          *   Continue checking the rest of the solution

  **3. Output Format**
  Your response MUST be structured into two sections:

  *   **a. Summary**
      *   **Final Verdict**: State whether the solution is correct, contains an incorrect verdict, or has justification gaps.
      *   **List of Findings**: Bulleted list of all issues found, each with:
          *   **Location:** Quote from the solution
          *   **Issue:** Brief description and classification

  *   **b. Detailed Verification Log**
      Provide step-by-step verification:
      1. Check if verdict (SAT/UNSAT) is clearly stated
      2. For SAT: Verify the proposed assignment against each condition
      3. For UNSAT: Verify the logical proof of impossibility
      4. Check reasoning soundness and completeness

  **Example Summary Format**

  **Final Verdict:** The solution is **incorrect** because it contains an Invalid Assignment.

  **List of Findings:**
  *   **Location:** "Setting x(0,0,0) = true satisfies all conditions"
      *   **Issue:** Invalid Assignment - Condition 5 requires x(0,0,0) = false when x(1,1,1) = true, but both are set to true.
  *   **Location:** "Therefore the problem is SATISFIABLE"
      *   **Issue:** Incorrect Verdict - The proposed assignment violates condition 5, so SAT claim is invalid.

  ### Reminder ###
  You are strictly a **verifier**. Report all issues but do not fix them or provide alternative solutions.
