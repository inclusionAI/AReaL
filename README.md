AReaL is an open-source **fully asynchronous** reinforcement learning training system
for large **reasoning and agentic models**, developed by the AReaL Team at Ant Group.
Built upon the open-source project [ReaLHF](https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF),
we are fully committed to open-source principles by providing training details, data,
and infrastructure required to reproduce our results along with the models themselves.
AReaL aims to help everyone build their own AI agents easily and affordably. Our team
loves milk tea because it's delicious, customizable, and affordable. We hope you enjoy
our project just as you enjoy real-world milk tea (cheers).

**AReaL Highlights**

- ‚ö° **Flexibility**: Seamless customization for
  [multi-turn agentic rollout](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/agent.html)
  workflows within a single file, and smooth integration with other agentic tooling
  frameworks.
- üöÄ **Scalability**: Through algorithm-system co-design, AReaL delivers **stable** fully
  asynchronous RL training with **industry-leading speed**. AReaL seamlessly adapts to
  diverse computational environments, scaling from a single node to 1,000+ GPUs.
- üî™ **Cutting-Edge Performance**: AReaL produces state-of-the-art
  [math](/blog/AReaL_v0_2.md), [coding](/blog/AReaL_v0_3.md), and
  [search agents](https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher) with exceptional
  capabilities.

## üì∞ News

**\[2025/08/30\]** Introducing ASearcher, a state-of-the-art search agent built with
AReaL's end-to-end asynchronous RL training. Check out the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07976) and the
[open-source repository](https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher)!

**\[2025/07/31\] (AReaL-lite)** We introduce AReaL-lite, a **lightweight** version of
AReaL designed specifically for AI researchers and rapid prototyping. AReaL-lite
features an **algorithm-first** API design that prioritizes ease of use and algorithm
development, while natively supporting **fully asynchronous agentic RL**. With 80% fewer
lines of code, AReaL-lite maintains 90% of AReaL's performance and core functionality.
Check out [our AReaL-lite design documentation](/areal/README.md) and
[the quickstart guide](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/tutorial/quickstart.html) to
begin your journey with **AReaL-lite**!

<details>
<summary><b>üìã Previous Releases</b></summary>

**\[2025/06/03\] (v0.3, boba¬≤)** We release **boba¬≤** (double-boba) for fully
asynchronous RL training, which achieves **2.77√ó speedup while delivering comparable or
superior training performance** compared to synchronous systems. Furthermore,
asynchronous RL significantly simplifies multi-turn agentic RL training setup! Check out
[our v0.3 overview blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_3.md) and the
[research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24298).

**\[2025/03/31\] (v0.2, boba)** Introducing our milestone release‚Äîboba! Please call it
A-ReaL-boba! This release features significantly faster training with SGLang support and
state-of-the-art 7B and 32B models for mathematical reasoning. Check out our
[v0.2 technical blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_2.md).

**\[2025/02/24\] (v0.1)** Our initial release includes reproducible results for 1.5B and
7B Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Check out our
[v0.1 technical blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_1.md).

</details>

## üöÄ Getting Started

Our training scripts automatically download the required dataset (openai/gsm8k) and
model (Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct). To run on a single node:

```bash
python3 -m areal.launcher.local \
  examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.py \
  --config examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.yaml
```

To run on a Ray cluster with 2 nodes and 8 GPUs per node (remember to update paths in
the YAML file to point to your shared storage):

```bash
python3 -m areal.launcher.ray \
  examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.py \
  --config examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.yaml \
  cluster.n_nodes=2 \
  cluster.n_gpus_per_node=8
```

For comprehensive setup instructions, see
[our quickstart guide](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/tutorial/quickstart.html).
