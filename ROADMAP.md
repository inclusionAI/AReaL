# AReaL Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for AReaL in the next
quarter. We welcome community feedback and contributions to help shape the future
direction of the project.

**Latest Release:** Check [releases](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/releases) for
the most recent version.

## 2025 Q4 Roadmap (due January 31, 2026)

### High Priority

**üîß Core Features**

- [ ] Single-controller mode: https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/issues/260
- [ ] Interactive tutorial notebooks
- [ ] Organize common training scripts into trainers (e.g., `GRPOTrainer`, `SFTTrainer`)
  to reduce code duplication in example scripts

**üåê Ecosystem Integration**

- [ ] OpenAI-agents and Camel-AI compatible API for agentic workflow building
- [ ] Integration with popular inference/training frameworks: ollama, litellm, etc.
- [ ] Additional VLM model support, especially Vision-MoE models

**üìö Documentation & Examples**

- [ ] More domain-specific examples (terminal use, tau2 bench)
- [ ] Performance tuning guides for different hardware and model setups

**üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure**

- [ ] Simplified package management and image building
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment support
- [ ] Auto-scaling based on workload
- [ ] Multi-cloud support enhancements
- [ ] Better monitoring and profiling tools
