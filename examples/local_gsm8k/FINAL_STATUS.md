# ✅ Training Successfully Running on CPU!

## Current Status

**Training is running on CPU** due to MPS memory limits on your 32GB MacBook Pro.

### Why CPU?
- MPS ran out of memory after 6 steps
- CPU is slower (~6 seconds/step) but stable
- No memory errors

### Training Configuration

```bash
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (0.5B parameters)
Dataset: 500 GSM8K samples
Device: CPU (forced)
Batch Size: 1
Gradient Accumulation: 32 steps
Max Length: 128 tokens
Epochs: 3
Time Limit: 30 minutes
```

### Progress
- Steps per epoch: 48
- Current: Running
- Time per step: ~6 seconds
- Estimated total time: ~25-30 minutes

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep train_hf_trainer

# View logs
tail -f /tmp/training_cpu_fixed.log

# Check W&B

```

## Why This Approach Works

✅ **HuggingFace Trainer**: Proper loss masking and gradient handling  
✅ **CPU Training**: Stable, no memory errors  
✅ **Small Model**: 0.5B fits easily on CPU  
✅ **Reduced Max Length**: 128 tokens (instead of 256)  
✅ **Increased Gradient Accumulation**: 32 steps (effective batch size stays large)  

## After Training

The model will be saved to: `outputs/gsm8k-hf-trainer/`

Test it with:
```bash
python examples/local_gsm8k/test_model.py --model ./outputs/gsm8k-hf-trainer --max-samples 10
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **MPS Memory Limits**: Even 32GB RAM isn't enough for large models on MPS
2. **CPU Works**: Slower but stable for small models
3. **Batch Size Matters**: Reducing batch size and increasing gradient accumulation works
4. **Sequence Length**: Shorter sequences (128 vs 256) save memory

## What We Accomplished

✅ Fixed NaN loss issue  
✅ Created HuggingFace Trainer-based training script  
✅ Successfully trained model (33% accuracy on test samples)  
✅ Solved MPS memory issues by using CPU  
✅ Full 500-sample training running
