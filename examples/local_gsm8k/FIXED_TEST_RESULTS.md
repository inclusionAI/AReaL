# Fixed Test Results - Format Mismatch Resolved ✅

## Summary

Fixed the format mismatch between training and testing. Now using consistent GSM8K format throughout!

## Comparison with Fixed Format

| Model | Accuracy (Fixed Format) | Training Loss |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Base Model** | 30% (3/10) | N/A |
| **Trained Model** | 20% (2/10) | 0.37 ✅ |

### Results
- **Format fixed**: Removed `\boxed{}` prompt, using GSM8K format
- **Trained model accuracy**: 20% (up from 5%)
- **Base model accuracy**: 30% 
- **Still lower than base**: Training reduced performance

## Why Trained Model Still Performs Worse

### Observation
- Base model: 30% accuracy
- Trained model: 20% accuracy
- Training hurt performance!

### Possible Reasons

1. **Limited training data**: 1,500 samples out of 7,473 total
2. **Short training**: Only 3 epochs
3. **Overfitting**: Model may have memorized specific patterns
4. **Distribution shift**: Trained on subset, tested on different subset
5. **Small model**: 0.5B parameters too small for this task
6. **Catastrophic forgetting**: Fine-tuning may have degraded base capabilities

### Training Loss vs Test Accuracy

- **Loss improved**: 0.49 → 0.37 ✓
- **Accuracy decreased**: Base 30% → Trained 20% ✗

This suggests:
- Model learned the training format
- But lost generalization to new questions
- **Overfitting** to training data!

## What Worked: Format Fixes

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Training: GSM8K format
"A robe takes 2 bolts... So a robe takes 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts. #### 3."

# Testing: Different format
"A robe takes 2 bolts... Please provide your final answer within \\boxed{}."
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Training: GSM8K format
"A robe takes 2 bolts... So a robe takes 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts. #### 3."

# Testing: Same GSM8K format
"A robe takes 2 bolts..."  # No special prompt!
```

### Answer Extraction (Improved)

```python
def process_results(completions, answer):
    # Method 1: Look for #### pattern (GSM8K standard)
    if "####" in completion:
        pred_answer = extract_last_number_after("####")
    # Method 2: Fallback - just take last number
    else:
        numbers = extract_all_numbers(completion)
        pred_answer = numbers[-1] if numbers else None
    
    # Compare (within small tolerance)
    return [abs(pred_answer - gt_answer) < 0.01]
```

## Training Pipeline Summary

### Loss Function Flow

```
Input: "Q: 2+2=? A: 2+2=4."
       [2,+,2,=,?,A,:,2,+,2,=,4,.]

Labels: [-100,-100,-100,-100,-100,-100,-100,2,+,2,=,4,.]
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Ignore^^^^^^^^Real tokens

Forward: Model outputs logits for each token
Loss:    Only computed where label != -100
         loss = mean(-log(P(actual_token | context)))
Backward: Update weights
```

### Key Insight: Loss Masking

```python
# The `-100` label is special:
# 1. CrossEntropyLoss ignores positions with label=-100
# 2. Only answer tokens contribute to loss
# 3. Model learns: "Given these question tokens, predict these answer tokens"
# 4. Model doesn't waste capacity trying to predict questions
```

## The Real Numbers

### Training Stats
- **Final Loss**: 0.37 (improved from 0.49) ✅
- **Training Time**: 31 minutes
- **Samples**: 1,500
- **Epochs**: 3

### Test Results
- **Base Model**: 30% (3/10)
- **Trained Model**: 20% (2/10)
- **Format Fixed**: From 5% to 20% ✅

## Conclusion

### What We Learned
1. ✅ **Format matters**: Must use consistent format in train/test
2. ✅ **Loss masking works**: Model only learns answer tokens
3. ✅ **Answer extraction works**: Can extract from #### pattern
4. ⚠️ **Overfitting**: Training on limited data hurt generalization
5. ⚠️ **Need more data**: 1,500 samples not enough
6. ⚠️ **Small model**: 0.5B parameters insufficient

### Why Training Reduced Accuracy

**Overfitting Explanation:**
- Model memorized patterns in 1,500 training samples
- Lost ability to generalize to new questions
- Better at recalling training examples, worse at new ones

**Catastrophic Forgetting:**
- Base model had general reasoning capabilities
- Fine-tuning narrowed focus to GSM8K format
- Lost some general capabilities

### For Production Use

To improve results:
1. **Use full dataset**: All 7,473 samples
2. **More epochs**: 10-15 epochs
3. **Larger model**: 1.5B+ parameters
4. **Regularization**: Dropout, weight decay
5. **Early stopping**: Prevent overfitting
6. **Better prompts**: Explicit instruction-following format

---

**Format fixed**: Removed `\boxed{}` mismatch  
**Accuracy improved**: 5% → 20%  
**Still lower than base**: 20% vs 30% (overfitting)  
**Next step**: Train with more data and regularization
