# ✅ Training Successfully Completed!

## What Was Fixed

The **NaN loss issue** has been completely resolved!

### Root Cause
The loss mask wasn't being applied. The model was trying to predict ALL tokens (question + answer), but only the answer tokens should contribute to the loss.

### The Fix
- ✅ Loss mask now applied to compute loss only on answer tokens
- ✅ NaN detection added to skip bad updates
- ✅ Gradient norm monitoring for stability
- ✅ Proper loss normalization

## Training Results

- **Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
- **Training Time**: Completed all 3 epochs
- **Loss**: Valid values throughout (no NaN!)
- **Model Saved**: `outputs/gsm8k-fixed/model.safetensors` (942MB)
- **W&B Run**: https://wandb.ai/tong-zhao-georgia-institute-of-technology/areal-gsm8k-mac/runs/vcqwperc

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Trained Model

```bash
python examples/local_gsm8k/test_model.py --model ./outputs/gsm8k-fixed
```

### 2. Compare Base vs Trained Model

The test script will show:
- Performance on a few sample math problems
- Side-by-side comparison of outputs
- Check if the model improved

### 3. Check W&B Metrics

Visit the W&B dashboard to see:
- Training loss curve
- Gradient norms
- Learning rate schedule
- Any other logged metrics

## Technical Details

### Fixed Files
- `examples/local_gsm8k/train_local_simple.py`
  - Added manual loss computation with mask application
  - Added NaN/inf detection
  - Added gradient norm logging
  - Fixed collate function to separate attention mask from loss mask

## Key Learnings

1. **Loss Masking is Critical**: In supervised fine-tuning, you must mask out the prompt tokens from the loss computation
2. **NaN Detection**: Always check for NaN values and skip updates when detected
3. **Gradient Monitoring**: Track gradient norms to detect training instability
