# Training Issue Summary

## Problem

The training completed successfully with valid loss values (no NaN), but the trained model is completely broken - it only outputs exclamation marks.

## What Happened

1. **Training Completed**: All 3 epochs finished with valid loss values
2. **Model Saved**: Model saved to `outputs/gsm8k-fixed/` (942MB)
3. **Test Results**: Model outputs only `!!!!!!!!!!!...`

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is with the **loss mask implementation**. While I fixed the NaN issue by applying the loss mask, the gradient flow through masked tokens may still be wrong.

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Loss Mask Application**: Applied correctly, but may need adjustment
2. **Token Shifting**: Loss mask is shifted for next-token prediction which should be correct
3. **Numerical Stability**: Possible overflow/underflow in loss computation

## What Needs to be Fixed

The loss computation needs debugging. Possible issues:

1. **Loss mask not properly excluding padding**: Padding tokens (0 in loss_mask) should be excluded
2. **Attention mask conflict**: Using loss_mask as attention_mask earlier may have corrupted gradients
3. **Numerical precision**: Float32 vs Float16 precision issues

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use HuggingFace Trainer (Recommended)
Switch to using the HuggingFace `Trainer` class which handles all loss computation properly:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments, DataCollator

# Use built-in trainer with proper loss masking
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    data_collator=collator,
    # Loss masking handled automatically!
)
trainer.train()
```

### Option 2: Debug Current Implementation
Add extensive logging to the loss computation to identify where it breaks:

```python
# Add debug logging
print(f"Loss mask sum: {shift_loss_mask.sum()}")
print(f"Masked loss before sum: {masked_loss}")
print(f"Final loss: {loss}")
```

### Option 3: Use a Simpler Approach
Use the `CrossEntropyLoss` with `ignore_index`:

```python
# Use ignore_index to mask tokens
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=-100)
# Set labels to -100 for tokens we want to ignore
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Training script runs without errors
- ✅ Loss values are valid (no NaN)
- ❌ Trained model doesn't work (outputs garbage)
- ❌ Loss masking implementation needs fixing

## Recommendation

Given the complexity, I recommend **switching to HuggingFace Trainer** which is battle-tested and handles SFT properly. This would require minimal changes but ensure proper training.
