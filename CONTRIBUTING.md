## Quick Start

1. **Fork and Clone:**

   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AReaL
   cd AReaL
   ```

1. **Install Development Dependencies:**

   Check our [installation guide](docs/tutorial/installation.md).

   ```bash
   # If you are using a local pip environment
   bash examples/env/setup-pip-deps.sh
   # Or you can use the docker image illustrated in the installation guide
   pip install -e .
   pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Install dev dependencies
   ```

   Note that we separate packages like `flash-attn`, `sglang`, and `vllm` from other
   pure python depedencies in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`. This is primarily
   due to a historical reason: we used the nvidia pytorch docker image, which delivers a
   customized pytorch version. Installing any packages that require compilation will
   overwrite the existing pytorch version thanks to pip dependency resolver. As a
   result, we decide to isolate these compilation-based packages and build them
   separately, either in the Dockerfile or in `examples/env/setup-pip-deps.sh`.
   `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` should work both in a local environment and
   in our provided docker container.

   Starting from v0.3.4, AReaL uses the SGLang docker image as the base image. It
   delevers an official pytorch version, and almost all packages should be able to be
   installed without compilation. The package dependency structure may be improved in
   the future.

1. **Set Up Code Formatting:**

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   # Run over all files if you have previous commits
   pre-commit run --all-files
   # The subsequent commits will automatically format your file
   git commit -a -m 'my change'
   ```

1. **Testing:**

   ```bash
   pytest -sv areal/tests/
   ```

   In the test suite, we:

   - Run over all examples to make sure that they can run one RL step
   - Check the individual functionalities of engines, including rollout,
     forward-backward, and weight update
   - Check the numerical consistency of our packed data format with HuggingFace padded
     input, with and without ulysses
   - Test the functionality of staleness management
   - Ensure that the GSM8k SFT loss is decreasing, RL rewards is increasing
   - Other unit-tests of individual components

   As such, some unit-tests may require multiple GPUs to run. The entrypoint scripts are
   placed under `areal/tests/torchrun`. In the corresponding test file, e.g.,
   `test_examples.py`, we use subprocess to launch distributed experiments with
   `torchrun`, and wait for the results in a file.

   Currently, the CI/CD pipeline usually fails because of network issues. We are using
   demestic machines for temporary usage. We are transitting to use machines in
   international cloud providers. Consequently, the PR contributor has to mantually run
   selective tests on a GPU machine and report the results in PR description.

## Code Quality Standards

### Code Formatting

We use automated formatting tools:

- **Python:** Black (line length: 88), isort, autoflake
- **C++/CUDA:** clang-format (Google style)
- **Markdown:** mdformat
- **Notebooks:** nbstripout, nbqa-black, nbqa-isort

**All formatting is enforced by CI and must pass.**

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Type Hints:** Add type annotations to function signatures

   ```python
   def compute_reward(prompt: str, completion: str) -> float:
       ...
   ```

1. **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings for classes and public functions

   ```python
   def rollout_batch(data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Execute rollout for a batch of prompts.

       Args:
           data: List of prompt dictionaries containing input_ids and metadata.

       Returns:
           Dictionary with padded tensors of trajectories and rewards.
       """
   ```

1. **Imports:** Organize imports (isort handles this)

   - Standard library
   - Third-party packages
   - Local/application imports

1. **Logging:** Use structured logging, not print statements

   ```python
   from areal.utils.logging import getLogger
   logger = getLogger(__name__)
   logger.info("Starting rollout", extra={"batch_size": len(data)})
   ```

1. **Async Code:** Keep workflows non-blocking, use `await` for I/O

   ```python
   async def arun_episode(self, engine: InferenceEngine, data: Dict) -> Dict:
       resp = await engine.agenerate(req)  # Non-blocking
   ```

1. **Configuration:** Use dataclasses in `areal/api/cli_args.py`, avoid hardcoded paths

1. **Error Handling:** Provide helpful error messages with context

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed code patterns and conventions.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

Add tests for new functionality:

```python
# areal/tests/test_my_feature.py
import pytest

def test_my_new_function():
    result = my_new_function(input_data)
    assert result == expected_output
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -s -v areal/tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest -s -v areal/tests/test_utils.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -s -v -k "test_allocation"
```

### GPU Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è Many tests require GPUs. If you don't have access:

- Mark GPU tests:
  `@pytest.mark.skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available(), reason="Requires GPU")`
- State testing limitations in PR description
- Maintainers will run GPU tests during review

### Documentation Tests

```bash
# Build docs locally
pip install jupyter-book
jb build docs

# Check for broken links and formatting
mdformat --check docs/
```
